This is a crucial point that the claim conveniently ignores.\n\nRegarding inflation, I agree that it's essential to consider the impact of inflation on gas prices. However, I believe that the claim's assertion that the average gas price in 2008 was equivalent to around $3.50 in today's dollars is an oversimplification.

This significant difference raises concerns about the accuracy of the claim.\n\nFurthermore, while Florida's job growth was impressive compared to other states in September, it's important to consider the context. Florida's job growth was not as impressive when compared to other states over a longer period of time. In fact, Florida's percentage job gains ranked eighth among the 50 states when looking at the data between September 2020 and September 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, while Florida did experience job growth in September, the claim that it accounted for 84,500 of the 194,000 jobs added is an exaggeration. I urge my opponent to reconsider their argument and provide more accurate information to the public.\n\nAssessment: The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but it is exaggerated and lacks context.

As a politician, I must emphasize that the claim \"The nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September, and Florida accounted for 84,500\" is not exaggerated, but rather a testament to the remarkable economic growth and resilience of our great state.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to acknowledge that job growth can fluctuate from month to month, and it's true that Florida's job growth in September was impressive compared to other months. However, I'd like to highlight that our state's consistent and sustained job growth over the past year is a clear indication of our economic strength and competitiveness.\n\nSecondly, I'd like to address the point that Florida's job growth may not be directly comparable to the national total of 194,000 jobs. While it's true that Florida's job growth was impressive, it's also important to recognize that our state's economy is a significant contributor to the national economy. In fact, Florida's economy is the third-largest in the country, and our job growth is a vital component of that.\n\nFurthermore, I'd like to emphasize that our state's economic growth is not just about job numbers, but also about the quality of those jobs. Florida's economy is diversifying, with industries such as technology, healthcare, and tourism driving growth and innovation. Our state is also investing in education and workforce development, ensuring that our workers have the skills they need to succeed in the modern economy.\n\nIn conclusion",

While it is true that Florida added a significant number of jobs in September, the claim does not accurately reflect the complexity of the data.\n\nFirstly, the claim implies that Florida's job growth was consistent and significant, but the data shows that there can be significant variations from month to month. In the previous month, Florida gained a net 20,500 jobs, which is a much smaller number than the 84,500 claimed. This suggests that the 84,500 jobs added in September may not be a consistent trend.\n\nSecondly, the claim compares Florida's job growth to the national total of 194,000 jobs, but this comparison is not accurate. Florida ranked second in the nation to Texas that month, but this ranking does not provide a clear understanding of the actual number of jobs added in Florida.\n\nIn conclusion, while Florida did experience significant job growth in September, the claim \"The nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September, and Florida accounted for 84,500\" is an oversimplification of the data.

The video showing a large group of migrants marching from Tapachula is a clear indication of the scale of the migration, and it is reasonable to assume that Rep. Miller was referring to this specific group.\n\nThirdly, Steven Camarota's statement is an expert opinion based on his analysis of the data, and it is unfair to dismiss it as an opinion rather than a fact.

The lack of supply has been blamed on a number of factors, including COVID-19 related supply chain issues, a recall that halted operations at a major formula manufacturer, and lingering drug shortages from before the pandemic. These factors are not natural or unforeseen, but rather the result of human actions or inactions.\n\nThirdly, the expert testimony of Marta Wosi\u0144ska, a health care economist, suggests that domestic manufacturing is not a panacea and that most shortages are caused by quality problems in both the United States and overseas.

This is supported by NASA's data, which shows that in 2019, the ice sheet lost about 532 gigatons, which is a record loss.

However, I must respectfully disagree with your conclusion that Greenland's ice sheet is shrinking more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago.\n\nFirstly, while it is true that Greenland lost ice at a faster rate this decade than 80 years ago, we must consider the context. The ice sheet has been losing ice at a steady rate over the past century, with some fluctuations. The 1930s were a period of significant ice loss, and it's unfair to compare the current rate of loss to that period without considering the overall trend.\n\nSecondly, the evidence presented by Koonin, which only goes up to 2010, is not necessarily outdated. In fact, it highlights the importance of considering the long-term trend, rather than focusing solely on recent fluctuations. The study's findings are supported by other research, which shows that the ice sheet has been losing ice at a steady rate over the past century.\n\nThirdly, while it's true that the ice sheet has lost more ice in recent decades, we must consider the overall mass of the ice sheet. The ice sheet is still massive, and even significant losses do not necessarily mean it is shrinking rapidly.

While it's true that the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects an increase in residential non-renewable energy expenditures, I believe the claim \"U.S. households are on track to spend $19 billion more on energy by 2030\" is still supported by the evidence.\n\nFirstly, the EIA's estimate of $18 billion (in 2020 dollars) is still a significant increase, and when adjusted for inflation, it translates to $19 billion in 2018 dollars, which is the basis of the original claim. Moreover, the EIA's projection is based on current laws and regulations, which may not accurately reflect future changes in energy policies or technological advancements.\n\nSecondly, while the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that the \"clean energy transition requires substantial quantities of critical minerals,\" this does not necessarily mean that the energy transition will lead to energy savings for consumers and environmental benefits. In fact, the transition to clean energy may require significant upfront investments and infrastructure changes, which could lead to increased costs for households.\n\nThirdly, the EIA's estimates of increased energy costs are not as drastic as the initial claim, but they still indicate a significant increase in energy expenditures. The average household spending on natural gas would jump 28% compared to the previous winter, while heating oil, electricity, and propane would increase by 27%, 10%,",

As we've discussed, this claim is based on a 2020 report prompted by a campaign promise to ban leasing and development for oil and gas operations on federal lands.\n\nWhile the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) does project an increase in residential non-renewable energy expenditures, we must consider the context. The EIA's estimates are based on current laws and regulations, which may not accurately reflect future changes in energy policies or technological advancements. Moreover, the actual increase in energy costs is not as drastic as the initial claim, with average household spending on natural gas and other energy sources projected to rise by 28% and 27%, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, the International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights the need for a clean energy transition, which will require significant investments in critical minerals. This transition will not only benefit the environment but also lead to energy savings for consumers.\n\nIn conclusion, while energy costs may rise, the magnitude of the increase is not as severe as initially claimed.

While it's true that the Earth's climate has fluctuated throughout history, the current warming trend is unprecedented and cannot be attributed solely to natural factors. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases, are the primary driver of this warming.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that there's nothing we can do to stop these cycles is simply not supported by the evidence.

As the article notes, until 1969, Virginia was dominated by a segregationist Democratic Party that won 21 straight gubernatorial elections dating to 1885. Eleven times during that span, they were elected with fellow Democrats holding the presidency. This suggests that there have been instances where a governor from the same party as the sitting president has won in Virginia.\n\nSecondly, the claim fails to account for the nuances of Virginia's political environment. As the article mentions, \"usually, there\u2019s some dissatisfaction with the incumbent president that plays a role in the gubernatorial election\" and that \"the party that lost the presidential election a year earlier is often highly motivated for the gubernatorial race.\" However, this does not necessarily mean that a governor from the same party as the sitting president cannot win.

    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The evidence suggests that Wisconsin has had competitive elections in recent years and has a mix of Republican and Democratic leaders, which partially supports the claim. However, the proposed redistricting maps do not necessarily reflect a 50-50 split, and the 2011 redistricting process was marked by gerrymandering, which contradicts the claim. The complexity of the issue and the nuances of the state's partisan divide also suggest that the claim is not entirely accurate."

However, the claim is misleading in its presentation of the data, as it implies that the Biden administration inherited gains of \"50,000 jobs a month\" without providing context, and it exaggerates the number of people dying from Covid. The data shows that the number of unemployed Americans peaked at around 23 million people in April 2020, nine months before Biden took office, and the number fell significantly before Biden was sworn in. Additionally, the administration's job creation record is not entirely accurate, as the data shows that the number of employed Americans rose from 125.2 million in January 2021 to 133.5 million in December 2024, a gain of 8.3 million jobs, or about 6.6%, over four years."

The strongest evidence that contradicts this claim is the fact that the venue, NRG Park, has a capacity of 200,000, based on fire codes. This information is provided by the city's fire chief, which suggests that the venue was not at capacity during the festival.\n\nAdditionally, the claim that the venue was at capacity is also disputed by the fact that city officials limited attendance at the festival to 50,000, which is significantly lower than the venue's capacity. This suggests that the venue was not overcrowded, and the claim that it was scheduled at a venue with a capacity of 20,000 is inaccurate.\n\nThe evidence provided by the event organizer, Live Nation, also contradicts the claim. According to the evidence, Live Nation is the world's largest live-event company, with $2.7 billion in revenue for its third quarter. This suggests that the company has the resources and expertise to manage events of various sizes, including large-scale festivals like Astroworld.\n\nIn contrast, the evidence that supports the claim is limited to a single statement from an unknown source that claims Live Nation scheduled the festival at a venue with a capacity of 20,000.

The evidence presented today has shown that this claim is a misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nFirstly, Dr. Fauci's statements were made in the context of an hour-long discussion about influenza, not COVID-19. This context is crucial in understanding his remarks, and it is essential to avoid cherry-picking quotes out of context.\n\nSecondly, Dr. Fauci's statement about lockdowns was not about coercion, but rather about the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the virus.

The evidence presented in this debate has shown that Dr. Fauci's statements were taken out of context, and his words were distorted to fit a narrative that is not supported by the scientific evidence.\n\nFirstly, the context in which Dr. Fauci made his statements is crucial. The NIAID has clarified that his statements were made in the context of an hour-long discussion about influenza, not COVID-19. This context is often omitted or distorted in the circulating videos and social media posts, which creates a misleading narrative.\n\nSecondly, the claim that Fauci said lockdowns are a method for coercing people to comply with COVID-19 vaccinations is also misleading. Fauci's actual statement was about using lockdowns to get people vaccinated so that when you open up, you won't have a surge of infections, because you're dealing with an immunologically naive population to the virus, because they've not really been exposed because of the lockdown. This statement is not about coercion, but rather about the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThirdly, the claim that Fauci said the COVID-19 vaccines aren't working is also debunked by the fact that he supports the CDC's recommendation that people who have recovered from COVID-19 still get vaccinated.

    "journalist_opening": "As a journalist, I will evaluate the claim that the United States has reduced its reliance on coal energy and is the only nation to do so. The strongest evidence that supports this claim is the data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker, which shows that the U.S. has retired more coal-fired units than any other country since 2000. This is corroborated by Champenois, a coal research analyst, who states that the U.S. has retired more capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000.\n\nHowever, there are also several pieces of evidence that contradict or complicate this claim. For example, the tracker's database counts a smaller number of coal-fired plants in the U.S. than Manchin's figure of 504, which is closer to the actual number of units. Additionally, China has retired a larger number of coal-fired units than the U.S., and many European Union countries have retired a much larger percentage of their existing capacity.\n\nFurthermore, while the U.S. has reduced its coal capacity from 340 gigawatts to 232 gigawatts, this decline is largely due to the increasing competitiveness of low-carbon alternatives and the shift away from coal driven by concerns about carbon emissions and climate change. This is supported by the fact that natural gas and coal produced about two-thirds of America's electricity in 2021, with wind, hydropower, and solar accounting for a smaller but growing share.\n\nIn conclusion, while the evidence",

As Senator Manchin pointed out, the United States had 589 coal-fired plants 10 years ago, and we are now down to 504. This reduction is a significant achievement, and it's a testament to our country's commitment to transitioning to cleaner energy sources.\n\nThe data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker supports this claim, showing that the U.S. has retired more coal-fired units than any other country since 2000. This is a remarkable feat, and it's a result of our country's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. has made significant progress in reducing its carbon footprint. According to the data, our carbon dioxide emissions have decreased by 970 million metric tons between 2005 and 2020, which is a significant reduction. This is a result of our country's efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and to increase energy efficiency.\n\nI understand that some may argue that China has retired a larger number of coal-fired units than the U.S., but I would argue that this is not a fair comparison. China's coal capacity is much larger than ours, so it's not surprising that they would retire more units.

While it is true that Medicare premiums have been growing steadily for decades, the current administration's policies, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act, have contributed to the increase in premiums.\n\nFirstly, the Inflation Reduction Act's funding changes to Medicare Part D could lead to higher premiums and fewer benefits for older Americans. This is because the act caps the annual increase in the base beneficiary premium at 6%, which may not be enough to keep up with rising healthcare costs. Additionally, the act's prescription cost caps for Medicare Part D may not be sufficient to offset the increased costs of prescription drugs.\n\nSecondly, the administration's \"reckless spending and socialist policies\" have contributed to the increase in Medicare premiums. The administration's policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, have increased government spending and have led to higher healthcare costs. This has resulted in higher premiums for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nThirdly, the administration's policies have also led to higher healthcare costs for seniors.

The editorial cited by O'Rourke suggests that Texas would have received an estimated $100 billion over the course of a decade, but more recent estimates suggest that Texas would receive federal funding between $5 billion and $6 billion annually, translating to a total of $50 billion to $60 billion over a decade.

This means that the increase in household income could potentially offset the impact of inflation. In fact, some economists argue that household income is a more accurate reflection of a family's economic well-being.\n\nRegarding the claim that lower-income Americans are disproportionately affected by inflation, I'd like to acknowledge that they do tend to spend a larger fraction of their income on goods. However, the data does not demonstrate a significant difference in the impact of inflation on different income groups.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim is partially supported, it requires further context and nuance. We must consider the full picture, including the impact of inflation on household income and expenses. As policymakers, it's our responsibility to ensure that our policies prioritize the economic well-being of all",

While this is a valid point, it is essential to consider the impact of inflation on the purchasing power of households. The evidence suggests that the cost of living has increased significantly, with households spending more on groceries, gas, and electricity. This means that even if household income has increased, the purchasing power of households has decreased.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not provide sufficient evidence to support the assertion that lower-income Americans are disproportionately affected by inflation.

The initial figure of 15,000 American citizens in Afghanistan was based on the known number of Americans in the country and the assumption that many would need evacuation given the Taliban's takeover (Washington Post analysis, August 29, 2021).\n2. The Task Force Argo website reported evacuating 2,663 people from Afghanistan, but it does not specify how many were Americans (May 25).\n3. According to a Philadelphia Enquirer report on October 21, 2021, 61 Americans were among the 2,160 moved from Afghanistan. Since then, around 500 people have been moved out, which would amount to a total of 561 Americans (Philadelphia Enquirer, October 21, 2021).\n\n**Contradictory evidence:**\n\n1. The U.S. has expelled, removed, or returned people out of the U.S. around 3.8 million times under Biden, according to PolitiFact's analysis (PolitiFact, no date).\n2.

The Washington Post analysis revealed that this figure was an estimate, not a confirmed number.

This lack of clarity undermines the claim that 10,000-15,000 Americans were left behind.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that the Biden administration has taken significant steps to evacuate American citizens from Afghanistan.

This reduction is specifically mentioned in the evidence provided, which states that the CBO estimates the total reduction will be about $34.5 billion.\n\nHowever, the evidence also presents a more nuanced picture of the bill's impact on health funding.

While my opponent may have presented some points that seem to suggest otherwise, I firmly believe that Grassley's vote against the debt ceiling bill was not a vote to slash Medicare.\n\nFirstly, Grassley's prepared statement clearly explains his objection to the procedural vote without the Senate's 60-vote requirement to increase the debt ceiling. This is a crucial point, as it shows that his vote was not a vote to slash Medicare, but rather a vote against the procedural aspect of the bill.\n\nSecondly, Grassley's history of supporting Medicare access and health care benefits is undeniable. His sponsorship of the Rural Health Clinic Protection Act and his votes to protect Medicare from sequestration cuts demonstrate his commitment to preserving Medicare access and health care benefits.\n\nThirdly, while my opponent may have pointed to the provision in the bill that would have protected Medicare funding from automatic cuts, I believe that this provision was not the primary reason for Grassley's vote. His prepared statement does not provide a clear explanation for why he voted against the bill despite this provision, and I believe that this lack of clarity undermines the opponent's argument.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that Chuck Grassley did not vote to slash Medicare. His vote against the debt ceiling bill was a vote against the procedural aspect of the bill, and his history of supporting Medicare access and health care benefits",

His prepared statement explained that he objected to the procedural vote without the Senate's 60-vote requirement to increase the debt ceiling, but he ultimately supported the bill.\n\nFurthermore, Grassley's history of supporting Medicare access and health care benefits is evident in his sponsorship of the Rural Health Clinic Protection Act, which was signed into law in April and spared Medicare from automatic 2% spending cuts. He also voted for legislation that protected Medicare from sequestration cuts. This demonstrates that Grassley is committed to preserving Medicare access and health care benefits.\n\nWhile the opponent's argument that Grassley's vote against the debt ceiling bill was not a vote to slash Medicare is weakened by the fact that the bill contained a provision that would have protected Medicare funding from automatic cuts, it is important to consider the context of the vote. Grassley's prepared statement explained his objections to the procedural vote, but it does not provide a clear explanation for why he voted against the bill despite the provision protecting Medicare.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence presented, I conclude that the claim that Chuck Grassley was \"voting to slash Medicare\" when voting against the debt ceiling bill is not supported by the facts.

The evidence mentions that President Barack Obama released a report with over 200 recommendations to improve broadband in 2010, and President Joe Biden has earmarked tens of billions of dollars for broadband expansion as part of his infrastructure bill. Additionally, the claim that Democrats have been pushing for more high-speed internet access for years is also supported by the evidence, as it mentions that Democrats have been advocating for this issue since the beginning of the Obama administration.\n\nHowever, the evidence also presents some contradictory points.

The data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) in England shows that none of the 15 deaths mentioned were under the age of 35, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports are not verified for accuracy and can contain errors. Additionally, the COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be highly effective in preventing severe illness and death, especially among vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. While there may be some adverse events reported following vaccination, the evidence does not support the claim that the vaccine has caused more deaths than COVID-19."

While it is true that Cratchit was a skilled worker, the context of the novel suggests that he was struggling to make ends meet and was often forced to work long hours for minimal pay. This is a common theme in Dickens' works, where he highlights the struggles of the working class during the Industrial Revolution.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that wages have increased substantially, but less than inflation, is misleading.

Profit margin is the percentage of revenue that a company retains as profit, and it can be a more meaningful measure of a company's financial performance than net income.

While it is true that policies limiting the movement of people played a significant role in the initial shutdown, I believe that the widespread adoption of vaccines has had a profound impact on the aviation industry.\n\nFirstly, the evidence suggests that the requirement for pilots and other employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 has led to a significant reduction in the number of flights.

The scientist's argument that public health measures, such as policies limiting the movement of people, played a significant role in the initial shutdown of flights is also supported by the evidence.\n\nThe most compelling evidence presented by the scientist is the lack of concrete evidence linking vaccines to pilot incapacitation or death. The claim that vaccines are causing pilots to die or become incapacitated in the air is baseless and lacks any concrete evidence.

Cold weather can cut an electric vehicle's range by as much as half, which could have significant implications for electric vehicles in a traffic jam.\n\nThirdly, the claim that electric vehicles can be charged at charging stations, which would not be feasible for gasoline-powered vehicles in a traffic jam, is an oversimplification. While it's true that charging stations are available, they may not be readily accessible in the midst of a traffic jam.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge my colleagues to consider the facts and evidence presented today. Electric vehicles are not inherently more prone to failure in traffic jams, and their performance in such situations is influenced by various factors, including the type of battery, heating system, and charging",

While it is true that electric vehicles do not use much power while at a standstill or in their climate settings, this does not necessarily mean that they would be more prone to failure in a traffic jam.\n\nIn fact, the evidence suggests that electric vehicles' motors do not run when the car is stationary, which means that the only draw on the battery is for the heating system and other electrical accessories.

    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that electric vehicles would not have fared well in the Virginia snowstorm traffic jam is partially supported by some evidence, but also partially contradicted by other evidence. While electric vehicles do not use much power while at a standstill or in their climate settings, which could have made them less affected by the traffic jam, they are not designed to operate in extreme cold weather, which could have made them more prone to failure in the Virginia snowstorm. The cold weather could have reduced the battery's capacity, making it more likely that electric vehicles would have run out of power. Additionally, the lack of redundancy in electric vehicles could have made them more prone to failure in the event of a breakdown. Therefore, the claim is neither entirely true nor entirely false, but rather partially true."

As a politician, I must emphasize that the accuracy and integrity of our claims are crucial in shaping public opinion and informing policy decisions.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that the claim may have been exaggerated, I strongly disagree with the notion that it is entirely inaccurate. The evidence provided does show that I received significant contributions from the pharmaceutical industry during my time in Congress, and I believe it is essential to acknowledge this fact.\n\nFirstly, I would like to clarify that the claim is not entirely false. According to OpenSecrets, I did receive more than $8.8 million from political action committees and individuals within the pharmaceutical and health products industry during my time in Congress. While this figure may not be the exact $8,550,422 claimed, it is still a substantial amount that warrants attention.\n\nSecondly, I would like to emphasize that the pharmaceutical industry's contributions to my campaign were not solely focused on my time in Congress.

This figure is significantly higher than the claimed $8,550,422.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument relies on a narrow interpretation of the data, focusing solely on the pharmaceutical industry's contributions to Biden's campaign. However, the evidence suggests that Biden received a total of $69,100 from the pharmaceutical industry during his 36-year tenure in Congress, ranking him 708th among members of Congress.

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim that Joe Biden holds the all-time record for the most money received from Pharma while in Congress is misleading and inaccurate.\n\nFirstly, the majority of Biden's total contributions came from his presidential campaign in 2020, not his time in Congress. This is a crucial distinction that the claim conveniently omits.\n\nSecondly, the claim focuses on the pharmaceutical industry's contributions to Biden's campaign, but neglects to mention that the majority of his total contributions came from other sources. This is a clear attempt to mislead the public and create a false narrative.\n\nThirdly, the claim's emphasis on the pharmaceutical industry's contributions to Biden's campaign ignores the fact that he has been a strong advocate for affordable healthcare and prescription drug prices. His efforts to cap insulin costs, reduce out-of-pocket drug expenses, and increase transparency in pharmaceutical pricing are all testament to his commitment to the public interest.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the public to be cautious of sensational and misleading claims that distort the truth.

Reynolds did not misrepresent the origin of the funds.\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided by the opponent's own statement from Iowa Senate Democrats on Facebook, which accuses Reynolds of not giving credit where credit is due, is not supported by the facts. The statement is based on an assumption that Reynolds did not mention the federal funds in her announcement, but the evidence shows that Reynolds' communications director, Alex Murphy, confirmed in an email to PolitiFact Iowa that the entire $210 million in new money was from the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law by President Biden.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that Reynolds did not initiate the program is not supported by the evidence. The Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program was established by an executive order in 2018, and since then, the state has allocated significant funds to support the initiative. While it is true that the latest round of grants includes federal funds, it is unfair to suggest that Reynolds did not play a role in the process.\n\nFinally, the opponent's argument that Reynolds should have been more transparent about the origin of the funds is not supported by the evidence.

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that Governor Reynolds did indeed misrepresent the origin of the funds for the Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program.

It is a social media post that lacks any credible evidence or context to support its claim. Furthermore, the post does not provide any evidence that Biden actually said \"dozens of police were killed\" during his speech.\n\nSecondly, the fact that Biden did not say \"dozens of police were killed\" during his speech is not evidence that he did not make the claim.

While this statement may seem to contradict the claim that dozens of police were killed, it is important to consider the context in which Biden made this statement.

However, this database does not provide evidence that Biden said \"dozens of police were killed\" during the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument relies on a selective reading of the evidence. The article states that Biden did not say \"dozens of police were killed\" during his speech on Jan. 6, but the opponent ignores the fact that Biden did say that \"violent crime is near a record 50-year low\" during a national police memorial service at the U.S. Capitol. This statement could be interpreted as a statement that contradicts the claim that dozens of police were killed.\n\nIn addition, the opponent's argument relies on a flawed understanding of the evidence. The article states that Biden did not say \"dozens of police were killed\" during his speech, but the opponent ignores the fact that Biden did say that \"you risk your lives every day for the safety of the people you don't even know\" during the same speech.
