      "For about a year in 1951, unemployment was under 4% while inflation was above 4%. But inflation then dropped to 1.1% or less for the six months immediately before a recession in 1953, so this is not unequivocal evidence for Summers\u2019 larger point about high inflation being a precursor to a recession.",

Admittedly, the \"other parts of the world\" is a bit vague, but we interpret it to mean the US is doing better than many other countries that \u2013 like it \u2013 are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.",

      "At the Senate hearing, Sullivan displayed a chart showing the change in carbon dioxide emissions in nine countries between 2005 and 2020. The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japan\u2019s emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while India\u2019s emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons.\nChart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan)\nSullivan\u2019s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan\u2019s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.",
      "Our World in Data provided a similar chart looking at per capita CO2 emissions for the same countries and time periods. The difference in this chart is that it shows not the percentage change, but rather the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons. This version of how the data is presented shows the U.S. and Japan leading in per capita CO2 emissions.",
      "Ritchie offered a simple explanation: Because China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, when their economies were far less developed, their emissions have grown a lot since then. Readers wouldn\u2019t know it from this graphic, but the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions, which didn\u2019t change very much over the same period.",
      "Jackson raised another issue with Sullivan\u2019s chart \u2014 it left out emissions per person. China\u2019s emissions are enormous, but the country also has 1.4 billion people. Viewed through that lens, despite the decline in U.S. emissions, the United States remained the larger emitter per capita.",
      "The part of the 2013 report about \"illustrative scenarios\" was talking about the human factors that are always tough to predict, like whether future governments would clamp down on greenhouse gas emissions, or the pace of economic growth. Both would affect levels of atmospheric carbon, but they have nothing to do with the way the models themselves were built.",

Critics perceived a memo by Bragg as laying out policies that would treat some cases too lightly, such as those involving resisting arrest and armed robbery.",

      "Bragg argued that investing in alternatives to incarceration would reduce recidivism and allow his office\u2019s resources to be dedicated to the most serious, and often violent, crimes. Reducing the prosecution of nonviolent offenses would disproportionately benefit people of color.",
      "\"It is very common\" for prosecutors to submit as evidence a summary of records that omits some they don't deem relevant, as an aid to the jury, said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a criminal defense attorney who worked at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office before Bragg took office. \"The judge will tell the jury this is what it is and what it is for. It is not considered tampering,\" Friedman Agnifilo said.",
      "\"Alvin Bragg is an independently elected state prosecutor who has nothing to do with Biden, the (Justice Department) or the federal government,\" said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a criminal defense attorney who worked at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office before Bragg took over. \"In fact, if Trump were convicted, even if he wanted to, Biden could not pardon him. It is wholly and entirely separate in every way.\"",

      "In 2022, Manhattan prosecutors reviewed\u00a015,710 felony arrests\u00a0and the office declined to prosecute 1,225 of them, or 7.8%. Of the felony cases that survived review, 52% were downgraded to a misdemeanor, 7% were downgraded to a lower-level felony, 8% were upgraded to a different felony, 33% were an equivalent felony, and in 0.1% of cases, 12 in all, the charge was downgraded to a violation. The data does not signal\u00a0why prosecutors changed the charges, though experts told us this practice is not unusual.",

Although\u00a0police officers must make decisions in the moment, prosecutors can take a longer view, weigh evidence\u00a0and think through how they can build a case, Harris-Calvin said.",

      "Bragg has also brought his own priorities to the office, which perhaps can be attributed to the increase in the percentage of felonies that were downgraded to misdemeanors in 2022, Meyers said.",
      "Under Bragg, prosecutors downgraded a greater share of felony charges to misdemeanors than in recent history in Manhattan. In 2021, under his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., 47% of felonies were downgraded to misdemeanors. In 2020, when the city was strained by\u00a0COVID-19 quarantines and related judicial delays, that figure was 35%. It was 39% in 2019 and 40% in 2018.",
      "We wondered whether\u00a0DeSantis was correct, if more than 50% of felonies in Manhattan were downgraded to misdemeanors.",
      "\"The more relevant prior position held by Colangelo is not his DOJ jobs, but the NY AG position in which he participated in the Trump Foundation investigation,\" Bowman said. \"I'd bet that Bragg hired him in part because of his familiarity with the intricacies of Trump's businesses and financial dealings. But, again, that proves exactly nothing about Biden influence on the Manhattan case.\"",
      "Under Bragg\u2019s memo, not all armed robberies would be downgraded to misdemeanors, just those determined not to \"create a genuine risk of physical harm.\"",
      "But in the recent past, before Bragg took over, the rates of downgrading felonies to misdemeanors were higher in other New York City boroughs. Similar state data compiled by the Data Collaborative for Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice shows that in 2021, the most recent year with available data, three other boroughs had higher rates: 56% in the Bronx, 57% in Brooklyn and 59% in Queens. (This data, which could have included a different set of cases, showed that in Manhattan in 2021, the rate was 52%.)",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis joined his fellow Republicans in\u00a0attacking\u00a0Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who presented evidence against former President Donald Trump to a grand jury. Trump, whom\u00a0the grand jusry indicted,\u00a0faces 34 felony counts\u00a0and is accused of falsifying business records to protect his\u00a0presidential aspirations.",
      "Attorneys general claims of recent reporting change",

Those numbers were from the United States only, the Instagram user wrote in the caption.\n\"Only 1% of deaths are reported according to Harvard study,\" the user wrote.",

      "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, research into the most effective masks and the most effective way to wear masks has continued to evolve.",
      "Fauci\u2019s public statements since the pandemic began show that he has not completely discounted the amount of protection natural immunity provides from COVID-19, but he has expressed uncertainty about how long the protection lasts with regard to this particular virus.",
      "An 18-year-old video of Dr. Anthony Fauci talking about the strength of natural immunity is making the rounds on social media, with some users alleging the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is ignoring the science now when it comes to COVID-19.",
      "Guidance surrounding the pandemic has changed since the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged as a global health threat in late 2019 and early 2020. But DeSantis\u2019 ad omits a lot of context, including about what was and wasn\u2019t known about the new virus at the time Fauci made these statements. It also selectively edits out key words and caveats, giving viewers a misleading impression about what Fauci actually said.",
      "Throughout the pandemic, DeSantis has taken positions contrary to public health guidance from experts. In July, he issued an executive order barring schools from requiring face masks, saying that mask guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lacked a \"well-grounded scientific justification.\" We rated that claim False.",

At the time, there was a concern about a shortage of personal protective equipment, called PPE, for health care providers.

      "Three years after a global pandemic prompted public health officials to recommend widespread mask-wearing, social media users warned that people who wore masks unknowingly subjected themselves to potentially devastating health risks.",
      "Contrary to what Pushaw suggested, the CDC based its decision on its view that the nation is in a \"stronger place\" in the pandemic because of the widespread availability of testing, vaccines, and other tools to prevent COVID-19. The relaxed mask recommendations for a large share of the U.S. were released in February.",
      "A law enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 allowed North Carolinians to wear masks in public to protect their health.",

      "\"We present data on COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status. These raw data should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness as the data does not take into account inherent biases present such as differences in risk, behaviour and testing in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.\"",

      "Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was referring to a new CDC study that found over 75% of deaths among vaccinated individuals involved people who had at least four comorbidities, such as another disease, risk factor or health condition. The statistic bolsters the argument that vaccines are effective against COVID-19.",
      "One of the many misinformed claims about COVID-19 vaccination is that it will weaken a person\u2019s immune system and make them more susceptible to other viruses.",
      "\"As data from serological surveys is compiled, this estimate will continue to evolve, including adjustments for new developments such as increasing numbers of people vaccinated,\" the WHO said in a statement emailed by a spokesperson. \"Irrespective of the precise estimate, COVID-19 remains a dangerous and deadly infectious disease, claiming thousands of lives each day.\"",
      "As of Oct. 18, more than 189 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the latest CDC statistics. Of them, 41,127 got COVID-19 and were hospitalized or died. That is 0.021%. About 85% of the deaths and 66% of the hospitalizations were among those 65 or older.",
      "In October, unvaccinated people had 10 times the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and 20 times the risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with people who were fully vaccinated with additional or booster doses, according to the CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker.",
      "Among the first 10 studies listed, nearly every one included similar language. One of the studies put it like this: \"Cases tend to be mild, do not usually require specific interventions, and potential risks of the vaccine are outweighed by the well defined risks of COVID-19 infection.\"",
      "The ONS data for England covers Jan. 1 to Oct. 31, 2021 and shows:\nTotal deaths related to COVID-19, by vaccination status, for people ages 10 to 19\nTotal deaths unrelated to COVID-19, by vaccination status, for people ages 10 to 19\nOf the 81 vaccinated children who died during this time, one had COVID-19. And of the 256 unvaccinated children who died, 20 had COVID-19.\u00a0The dataset does not list the cause for non-COVID-19 deaths.\nThe sample size of vaccinated children is much smaller than that of unvaccinated children because for most of 2021 in England, the COVID-19 vaccine was available only to children who had health conditions that could make them more vulnerable to a serious case of the disease. The vaccine became widely available to all children 12 to 17 years old in August 2021. Children under 12 became eligible for the vaccine in December 2021.",
      "More than 459 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through Nov. 29, 2021, according to the CDC. During this time, VAERS received 10,128 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine, agency spokesperson Martha Sharan told PolitiFact in an email. That includes people who died of any cause.",
      "In the more than three years since COVID-19 vaccines first became available, billions of doses have been administered worldwide, protecting against severe disease and death. Still, social media posts claim the vaccines are causing more harm than good.",

      "There is no evidence that suggests only those who are fully vaccinated should fear the newly discovered omicron variant. Studies show that the available vaccines are",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that the U.K. studies compared populations of people who had tested positive for COVID-19. Those who didn\u2019t contract omicron would have been infected by another variant, possibly one associated with more serious health effects.",
      "While scientists are still studying how effective existing COVID-19 vaccines are against the omicron variant, experts said that being vaccinated does not put people at greater risk.",
      "Early indications suggest that omicron might result in milder illness. But it also appears to be highly transmissible. Because hospitalizations and deaths usually lag outbreaks of cases, experts still need time to study the trends.",
      "Recent data from the United Kingdom\u2019s Office for National Statistics showed that infected people who had been fully vaccinated and had a booster shot were more likely to test positive for the omicron variant of COVID-19 than were unvaccinated people.",

      "Among the first 10 studies listed, nearly every one included similar language. One of the studies put it like this: \"Cases tend to be mild, do not usually require specific interventions, and potential risks of the vaccine are outweighed by the well defined risks of COVID-19 infection.\"",
      "We fact-checked a similar statement by Biden in October when he said people who are vaccinated for the coronavirus \"cannot spread it to you.\" We found at the time that studies showed a vaccinated person was less likely to spread the virus, but the risk wasn\u2019t zero.

      "As for the U.K. data, Johnson\u2019s office pointed to a paragraph in the press release that reads, \"Those who have received three doses of a vaccine and test positive for COVID-19 are more likely to be infected with infections compatible with the Omicron variant compared with those who are unvaccinated.\"",

He was referring to how well two doses of the vaccine protected specifically against infection by the omicron variant.",
      "The omicron variant of COVID-19 has proved to be less severe than previous strains of the virus, but deaths in the U.S. have remained high due to its higher transmissibility, health experts have said.",
      "\"This is because there are key differences in the characteristics and behaviour of individuals who are vaccinated compared to those who are unvaccinated,\" the agency explained. \"The rates therefore reflect this population\u2019s behaviour and exposure to COVID-19, not how well the vaccines work.\"",

      "For instance, the theory\u2019s inability to explain the U.S. economy since the 1990s may have been because of strong growth in productivity, Burtless said. Productivity gains enabled workers\u2019 wages to grow even as overall costs for employers remained low. This produced the combination of relatively low unemployment and relatively low inflation. Intensifying globalization, which put competitive pressure on U.S. producers to keep price increases small,\u00a0may also have played a role.",

Instead, it gives countries and states guidelines to consider when developing their own parental consent requirements. So WHO isn\u2019t making the rules. Countries and states are.",
