    "claim": "\"Gas prices were WAY higher in 2008, under REPUBLICAN president George W. Bush.\"",
    "evidence_full_text": [
      "President Joe Biden has faced a lot of criticism from Republicans for the rise in gasoline prices since he took office. But the left-wing social media account Occupy Democrats claims that under one Republican president, prices were far higher.",
      "\"You won’t see THIS on Fox ‘News’: Gas prices were WAY higher in 2008, under REPUBLICAN president George W. Bush,\" Occupy Democrats wrote on Facebook. The post included images of two gas station price signs, labeled 2008 and 2021.",
      "Statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration back up the claim about prices. During the past 20 years, the highest gas prices occurred in July 2008, during the Bush administration.",
      "But the statement leaves out important context. Some of the lowest prices of the past 20 years also occurred during the Bush administration, which included both the post-9/11 economic slowdown and the 2008 Wall Street crash and financial crisis.",
      "Indeed, gas prices have fluctuated within and across administrations, with little correlation to which president or party is in power. As with most things, the price of gasoline is determined not by the president, but rather by the state of the economy and the balance of supply and demand. Following our inquiries, Occupy Democrats changed its post to reflect this.",
      "Occupy Democrats cofounder Rafael Rivero told PolitiFact that the point of its original claim was to highlight the context that it says was missing from critiques of the Biden administration. The fact that prices were at historic highs during the Bush administration \"is conveniently ignored by the chorus of Fox News anchors blaming Biden for today’s rising prices,\" Rivero said.",
      "Today’s gas prices are around $3.32 a gallon, up from $2.37 when the Biden administration took office, according to the EIA. That’s still well off the peak of about $4.11 in July 2008.",
      "But Bush’s term also included two major economic shocks that sent gasoline prices tumbling. The first was the 9/11 attacks in 2001. By the end of that year, gas prices were around $1.07. The other was the 2008 mortgage crisis and Wall Street collapse, near the end of his second term. By the time Obama took over, gas prices were down to about $1.83.",
      "While the health of the economy influences the demand side of the price balance, global supply is largely controlled by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.",
      "\"OPEC tries to control the price of oil by either increasing or decreasing production to keep the price of oil stable,\" De Haan said.",
      "In 2001, the average price of oil set by OPEC countries was around $23 a barrel. That low price incentivized more consumption, and global demand began to rise during Bush’s second term, De Haan said.",
      "\"People became so accustomed to low energy that they made long-term decisions based on that. People were driving big cars, people were living hours away from (work) in some cases,\" De Haan said.",
      "By the middle of 2008, USA Today reported, oil prices spiked past $147 a barrel due to rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran, as well as supply disruptions in Nigeria and Brazil. That’s when prices hit their peak above $4 a gallon.",
      "Then came the crash, followed by another recovery under President Barack Obama’s administration that sent prices back toward the $4 mark in 2011 and 2012.",
      "In November 2014, in order to compete with production in other countries like the U.S., OPEC changed its policy to produce as much oil as possible and flood the market, which led to very low prices. Those low prices continued into the Trump years, until OPEC once again adjusted its policy to raise prices."

      "\"We’ve created more jobs in the first eight months of my administration than any president in American history — total number of jobs created,\" Biden said in the Oct. 21 town hall hosted by CNN’s Anderson Cooper.",
      "We’ve looked at this claim multiple times during Biden’s presidency, but since time has passed, new jobs figures require us to make new calculations each time. So we’ve done that here.",
      "We found that the Biden administration has indeed overseen record-setting gains in jobs, as long as you measure them by raw numbers, which the last part of Biden’s sentence suggests is what he meant.",
      "But this glosses over the fact that the total number of employed Americans has grown over time. And the comparison also ignores other important context.",
      "The official government data shows that between January 2021, when Biden took office, and September, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 147.6 million, or a gain of nearly 5 million jobs.",
      "In numerical terms, that’s a bigger gain in jobs than for the equivalent period under every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. (This comparison leaves out Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, each of whom initially assumed the office without being elected.)",
      "The closest competitor to Biden was Jimmy Carter, with a gain of 2.8 million jobs.",
      "However, Biden’s claim leaves out at least four important bits of context.",
      "Raw numbers vs. percentages. By choosing to highlight jobs gained as his metric, Biden has an advantage in a comparison with previous presidents. The U.S. population has grown, and so has the labor force.",
      "A fairer metric for comparison is the number of jobs gained divided by the starting level of jobs when the president took office. By this metric, Biden scores well, but he’s not No. 1. That distinction goes to Carter, who oversaw job gains of 3.5%, compared with Biden’s 3.4%.",
      "Comparison to the pre-pandemic level. The U.S. economy is still about 5 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak — 147.6 million jobs in September 2021, compared with 152.5 million jobs in February 2020."

    "claim": "\"The nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September, and Florida accounted for 84,500.\"",
    "evidence_full_text": [
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took a victory lap after the federal government released job numbers for September.",
      "DeSantis, a Republican, posted on Oct. 22 that \"Florida is driving the nation’s economy forward — the nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September, and Florida accounted for 84,500.\"",
      "DeSantis made a similar point during a press conference on Oct. 25. He used the same two numbers and said that \"almost half of the nation's (job growth) output was just in Florida.\"",
      "We found that Florida does have reason to be pleased with its showing in jobs for September. But DeSantis’ comparison of the two figures is exaggerated. Both numbers come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but they are calculated differently.",
      "Florida’s number, 84,500 net jobs, is impressive compared with what other states produced. In numerical job gains, Florida ranked second in the nation to Texas that month.",
      "Florida is the nation’s third most-populous state, so measuring job gains by raw numbers does risk giving it an unfair boost in a 50-state comparison. But in this case, Florida did well on a percentage basis, too. In fact, measuring by percentage gains from the previous month, Florida would actually leapfrog Texas to No. 1 in the national rankings for job growth.",
      "That said, this state number may change, and the numerical comparison DeSantis made to national figures isn’t apples-to-apples.",
      "The numbers are subject to revision. Not only are these numbers preliminary, but figures for individual states have a larger margin for error than the national numbers do, and the eventual revisions made to the September numbers in subsequent months could make \"significant\" changes to the 84,500 figure, said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist. (Of course, the revision could push the numbers higher, rather than lower.)",
      "There can be significant variations from month to month. During the previous month, Florida gained a net 20,500 jobs, or about one-fourth of the total in September. That ranked Florida 17th nationally for percentage job growth.",
      "The month-to-month variations can be especially affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to ups and downs in what sectors are expanding or contracting at a particular time. And Florida’s bounceback in September may have had something to do with the lower job growth the previous month.",
      "Economists say a better way to look at the numbers is to use a longer timeline, so that month-to-month variations are smoothed out.",
      "So we looked at the data between September 2020 and September 2021. Florida did well, but it wasn’t as much of an outlier as it was in the most recent month alone. Year over year, Florida’s percentage job gains ranked eighth among the 50 states.",
      "The two numbers DeSantis compared aren’t really apples to apples. The biggest caveat is the relationship between the two numbers DeSantis cited in his post."

Colin Allred, D-Dallas, who has emphasized the devastating economic effects of the pandemic as a reason why Americans need some of the social safeguards guaranteed in the Build Back Better bill. While speaking on MSNBC on Oct. 25, Allred pointed out the pandemic's disproportionate economic effect on women.",

      "When asked about the statistics, Allred's office pointed to an April Pew Research Center article that found, in an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, a net 2.4 million women dropped out of the workforce from February 2020 to February 2021.",
      "Bureau of Labor Statistics data from the Current Population Survey indicates 77,534,000 women ages 16 and over were in the labor force in February 2020 and 75,149,000 women were working in February 2021. The difference between those numbers is nearly 2.4 million women.",
      "If you wanted to update those numbers, there were 75,737,000 women working in October 2021. The difference between that February 2020 value — before the March 2020 plummet — and October 2021 is nearly 1.8 million women.",
      "So, there were 1.8 million fewer women in the labor force in October than in February 2020.",
      "That shows a significant number of women have rejoined the workforce since February 2021, but the number of women working is still much lower than pre-pandemic levels.",

      "U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis says his state was recently the hardest-hit by rising gas prices.",
      "\"Gas in North Carolina increased 14 cents per gallon this past week, the highest in the nation,\" Tillis tweeted on Oct. 26.",
      "A Tillis spokesperson told PolitiFact the senator’s tweet was meant to compare North Carolina’s price increase to those in other states. And he said it’s based on data from AAA, one of the largest vehicle and travel organizations in the country.",
      "Experts told PolitiFact that North Carolina’s gas situation isn’t necessarily worse than other states. But Tillis’ tweet appears to accurately reflect price fluctuations over the previous seven days.",
      "AAA tracks gas prices across America to see how they compare to previous weeks, months, and years. The group announced in an Oct. 25 press release that the national average price for a gallon of gasoline had risen six cents since Oct. 18 to hit $3.38 for a gallon of unleaded.",
      "AAA singled out North Carolina and Florida as states that experienced the largest increase in gas prices, 14 cents.",
      "North Carolina’s average price increase between Oct. 17 and Oct. 24 was also the largest of any state tracked by GasBuddy.com, which collects data from more than 100,000 stations across the country.",
      "Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said the average gas price in North Carolina rose 15 cents per gallon. While groups such as AAA capture accurate data, De Haan noted that the weekly snapshots can quickly become outdated.",
      "\"Gas prices fluctuate throughout the course of the day,\" he said. \"Just like the stock market constantly moves, gas prices constantly move.\"",
      "Thus, other snapshots can yield different results, De Haan said. For example, De Haan said GasBuddy data from Oct. 27 showed North Carolina with the 11th-largest price increase over the most recent seven days, and the third-largest increase over the previous month.",
      "AAA’s reports list the 10 states with the largest gas price increases. North Carolina’s price hikes didn’t make the list in AAA’s Oct. 18, Oct. 14, or Oct. 11 reports.",

      "Experts have repeatedly said gas prices are rising across the country because there’s not enough supply for increasing demand.",
      "\"The cost of crude oil, a global commodity, accounts for more than 50% of the price at the pump,\" Andrew Gross, AAA’s public relations manager, told PolitiFact NC in an email. He added that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, known as OPEC, \"still isn't producing at pre-pandemic levels, and it is leading to the higher cost.\"",
      "Experts have told PolitiFact and PolitiFact North Carolina that the increase isn’t tied to presidential policies. \"The bulk of what we’re dealing with is COVID-related.

The article covers the fact the U.S. is in talks to pay settlements of \"around $450,000 a person\" to resolve lawsuits filed on behalf of parents and children that were separated at the border during the Trump administration.",
      "Those lawsuits -- and the fact federal taxpayers may be on the hook for major payouts if the government loses -- were not mentioned in Steil’s claim.",
      "About 5,500 children were separated from their parents at the southern border under President Donald Trump’s \"zero-tolerance\" policy, mainly in spring 2018, according to an Oct. 28, 2021 New York Times report.",
      "Under the Trump-era policy, thousands of children ranging from infants to teens were taken from their parents, with no provisions to later reunite them. During their time away from their families, many children suffered from issues including heat exhaustion, malnutrition, freezing temperatures and a lack of medical attention.",
      "The family separation policy was a key component of the administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, aimed at deterring people from coming to the U.S.",
      "The policy also affected families that were legally entitled to asylum due to persecution in their home countries. So, in those cases, the families were not \"illegal immigrants\" at all, but people who followed the protocols for seeking asylum.",
      "Under the policy, Border Patrol agents charged parents with illegally entering the U.S., imprisoned them and placed their children in government-licensed shelters around the country, the New York Times report said. In early summer 2018, a judge ordered the government to rescind the policy, but government officials then struggled to reunite families.",
      "Lawsuits filed regarding the border separations have described mental-health problems for the children, resulting from the trauma of not having their parents during months of hard conditions, the Wall Street Journal report said.",
      "Justice department lawyers have been working to settle the cases, and Biden has assembled a task force made up of representatives of the departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services and State, to reunite migrant families that remained separated and determining how to make amends for the harm caused by the policy, according to the New York Times.",
      "All of that said, the final payment figures are far from clear -- as is the question of when the various lawsuits will be resolved, be it through settlements or at trial.",
      "According to the Wall Street Journal report, sources said families could receive payments close to $1 million in payments -- $450,000 per family member impacted by the policies -- but final numbers could shift.

      "Ritchie offered a simple explanation: Because China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, when their economies were far less developed, their emissions have grown a lot since then. Readers wouldn’t know it from this graphic, but the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions, which didn’t change very much over the same period.",
      "A different way of looking at the data provides more context.",
      "Our World in Data provided a similar chart looking at per capita CO2 emissions for the same countries and time periods. The difference in this chart is that it shows not the percentage change, but rather the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons. This version of how the data is presented shows the U.S. and Japan leading in per capita CO2 emissions.",
      "The difference in charts from Our World in Data depends on whether the \"relative change\" option was selected. Checking this box shows the percentage change over time and makes it appear as though China and India are leading in CO2 emissions compared with other developed nations."

      "\"And I also think it overlooks the fact that only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote. I mean, the commission cannot force facilities, private facilities, to allow special voting deputies or anyone into a private care facility.\"",
      "Is Wolfe right that \"only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote\" and the commission  \"cannot force facilities, private facilities, to allow special voting deputies\" inside?",
      "When asked for backup, Wolfe’s staff pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to state statutes addressing the issue.",
      "Let’s start with Wisconsin statute 54.25(2)(c)1.(g), which says, in part:",
      "\"No person may be denied the right to register to vote or the right to vote by reason that the person is alleged to be incapable of understanding the objective of the elective process unless the person has been adjudicated incompetent in this state.\"",
      "\"Regardless of whether a guardian is appointed, a court may declare that an individual is not competent to exercise the right to register to vote or to vote in an election if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapable of understanding the objective of the elective process.\"",
      "Rick Esenberg, president and general counsel of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, said the first part of the statement is \"generally correct.\"",
      "\"A person may not be denied the right to register or vote because he or she is unable to understand the objective of the electoral process without a judicial finding,\" he wrote in an email, adding: \"A nursing home administrator, relative, special voting deputy, municipal clerk or, for that matter, WEC could not make the decision that someone is incompetent to vote.\"",
      "On the second part of the claim, that the commission cannot force facilities to allow deputies inside, Wolfe’s office pointed to state law that covers the limits of what the commission can do.",
      "And its discretion, understandably, is on election officials. According to Wisconsin statutes 5.06(6):",
      "\"The commission may, after such investigation as it deems appropriate, summarily decide the matter before it and, by order, require any election official to conform his or her conduct to the law, restrain an official from taking any action inconsistent with the law or require an official to correct any action or decision inconsistent with the law. The commission shall immediately transmit a copy of the order to the official. An order issued under this subsection is effective immediately or at such later time as may be specified in the order.\"",
      "That is, the commission has the ability to order an election official to do something or not under that section. But that doesn’t mean the commission can order someone else to do something -- in this case, a private care facility owner, operator or staff member to allow election workers inside.",
      "\"These look to be accurate statements of Wisconsin law,\" said Robert Yablon, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School, of Wolfe’s claim. \"I am not aware of any statute or court decision that expressly empowers the Elections Commission to compel private care facilities to allow in special voting deputies.\"",
      "Esenberg, meanwhile, called this part of Wolfe’s claim \"a bit of a misdirection.\"",
      "\"Sec. 6.875 empowers municipal clerks to send (special voting deputies) to residential care facilities,\" he said. \"I am not aware that anyone has ever tested whether that implies a legal obligation for licensed facilities to let them in.\""

      "That is, it’s just a way of defining the statistical probability of a severe storm. For instance, just because there were 11 inches of rain in one day in one year, doesn’t mean that Wisconsin won’t see 11 inches of rain in one day again for another 500 years.",
      "In theory, these types of events with such low statistical probabilities are rare, meaning that it might not make sense for cities, engineers and others to plan around the possibility of them happening -- though that is being rethought, as 500-year storms and floods are happening more often due to climate change, according to an August 2017 report from Vox.",
      "When we asked Baldwin’s team about her claim that the storms were both 500-year events, they sent a host of links from the National Weather Service with data from both events.",
      "According to the data, the 2016 storm did indeed reach the threshold for a 500-year storm in some places, including the community of Saxon Harbor. In other places, the storm reached even higher thresholds.",
      "The storms that pummelled the area in 2018 also reached similar thresholds, with some areas sustaining 500-year rainfalls or higher, according to the NWS.",
      "But the Northwoods aren’t the only area where severe storms have risen to the same 500-year level. Storms in southern parts of the state around the same time also met that definition."

      "\"The NO votes cast by Hinson and Miller-Meeks on the infrastructure bill (13 Republicans voted yes) is a powerful reason to replace them in ‘22. Denying rural Iowans broadband alone shows how terribly partisan these two are.\"",

      "But did voting no, along with Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, on the infrastructure mean Hinson and Miller-Meeks wanted to deny Iowans broadband, as the comment implies? The answer requires context and explanation.",

That’s Washington gamesmanship at its absolute worst and the very definition of chaos and dysfunction that Iowans sent me here to fight against,\" Hinson said in the statement.",
      "Of the entire $1.2 trillion package, $100 million will be allocated to each state for broadband. According to The New York Times, the bill is being paid for by repurposing jobless benefit money and using untouched small business loan funds and other pandemic relief funds.",
      "In a press release following the vote, Miller-Meeks said she has been calling for a fully funded bipartisan bill that would improve bridges, roads, broadband, locks, dams and the electric grid. She listed broadband as a priority twice in her press release, despite her eventual vote.",

The House took separate votes on the two measures, passing the infrastructure bill on Nov. 8 and the social spending package on Nov. 19",
      "Loebsack said the reasons Miller-Meek and Hinson gave for voting no did not make sense to him. He said voting against the bill meant opposing all aspects of it. He said he singled out Miller-Meeks and Hinson, rather than Feenstra, because they are the representatives from the areas he is most familiar with in Iowa.",
      "\"That was a standalone vote. There were 13 Republicans who voted for that bill who had the courage to vote for that bill. But Miller-Meeks and Hinson are not among those 13 Republicans. And that’s what’s unfortunate,\" Loebsack said."

      "The statute provides narrow exceptions for abortion beyond 15 weeks. It would be allowed to protect the life of the woman, or if there was \"a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" A major bodily function includes \"functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, and digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.\"",

      "We decided to see if Reeves had his numbers right.",
      "We found that there are different ways of categorizing abortion laws in Europe. Reeves relied on one analysis, but that study made no allowances for broad exceptions in countries’ laws that could extend the cutoff point for a legal abortion well past the 15-week mark. We counted at least 15 countries where that could happen, with potentially 11 additional ones.",
      "Reeves’ office told us his data came from a report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion study center. Chief Justice John Roberts referred to it during oral arguments.",
      "The authors made it clear that they weren’t looking at every European nation, just those that they consider to allow elective abortions. Elective is the key word. As the Lozier Institute defines it, it means when a woman can seek an abortion without meeting certain conditions.",
      "This definition eliminated eight countries, including Britain (with a 24-week cutoff) and Finland (with a range of cutoffs from 12 to 20 weeks), because, the authors argued, the laws there required women to provide \"some\" justification for an abortion beyond it being their choice.",
      "But their definition of \"elective\" can be subjective. In Britain, two medical professionals have to agree that a woman’s mental or physical health is at risk. In the Netherlands, a doctor has to agree with the woman’s claim that she faces a \"distressed situation.\" The Lozier Institute study counts the Netherlands, but excludes Britain.  (Northern Ireland, the other part of the United Kingdom, is included.)",
      "That said, within the group of countries they selected, the authors looked at the cutoff point for legal abortions before considering any special factors, such as profound fetal abnormalities, or factors affecting the woman.",
      "\"Out of the 42 European countries that allow elective abortion, 39 countries limit elective abortion to 15 weeks’ gestation or earlier,\" the report said.\nContrast that with an assessment of a group of European law professors in their amicus curiae brief on behalf of the woman’s abortion clinic in the Mississippi case.\n\"Abortion is permitted through at least 22 weeks of pregnancy in 37 states and through 18-21 weeks in a further three, either on request, or on broad socioeconomic grounds, or on a ... criterion that does not entail a risk to her life,\" they wrote.",

      "\"On its face, a 15-week limit is more permissive than a shorter limit,\" said Carter Snead, a law professor at University of Notre Dame. \"Some have suggested that the European laws are more permissive because of their various exceptions, but this strikes me as mere speculation, because to assess that claim we would need to compare how such exceptions are interpreted and enforced alongside the Mississippi law's exceptions.\"",
      "The Lozier Institute took a narrow approach. Its study looked at one part of each country’s law — the baseline period during which elective abortions are legal. It didn’t factor in the reasons that period could be extended or for how long.",
      "\"Looking at abortion laws in their broader context reveals that comparable countries which, on their face, set shorter time limits on abortion access than the United States, often provide greater flexibility in obtaining abortions after those limits pass, with exceptions for a broad range of circumstances,\" according to a brief from a group of law professors in support of the abortion clinic.",
      "With the help of several databases — one from the United Nations, one from the World Health Organization, and a list from the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard — we examined the text of the laws of the countries the Lozier Institute examined, sometimes using Google Translate for our research.",

      "In the most restrictive category, 10 to 12 weeks, are 24 countries, including Northern Ireland. But 15 of those countries have exceptions for specific economic or mental-health reasons that extend the cutoff to 15 weeks or more.",
      "The middle category, 12 to 14 weeks, includes 15 countries. All but four of these countries have exceptions for the health of the mother. Their laws don’t say if health is limited to physical health, or if it extends to mental health — a more subjective criterion. But if the exceptions apply broadly, they can extend the legal period for an abortion to the 15-week point or beyond.",

    "evidence_full_text": [
      "An advertisement from the Community Oncology Alliance, part of a $1.6 million campaign running both on radio airwaves and in print, attacks a proposal in the Democratic-backed Build Back Better package approved by the House last month and now headed to the Senate.",
      "The ads, which started on Nov. 29 and are set to run through Dec. 12, say parts of the legislation would have \"serious unintended consequences\" for cancer patients — specifically, that \"an independent analysis shows that payments for cancer care will be slashed by close to 45%, causing cancer clinics to close and massively raising your healthcare costs.\" The alliance is an advocacy and lobbying organization representing physicians and clinics involved with cancer care.",
      "The Build Back Better plan is the Biden administration’s legislative proposal that includes an array of health provisions, from plans to curb prescription drug costs to expansion of Medicare coverage. The provision targeted by the alliance’s ad would empower the federal government to negotiate prices for a small set of yet unnamed expensive drugs, including cancer treatments, with the aim of lowering prices, an important campaign promise by both President Joe Biden and numerous congressional Democrats.",
      "That got us wondering: Would the plan really result in reduced payments for cancer care and higher health care costs, as the ads claim?",
      "Because drug pricing and negotiations — as well as the Senate action on the proposal — are such hot news right now, we took a closer look.",
      "The experts we talked to expressed no doubt that certain provisions of the Build Back Better proposal, if passed into law, would reduce some payments to oncology offices. But we found that the advertisement leaves out key details about the scope of those cuts, an omission that could mislead people who hear or see the ads.",
      "The oncologists’ ad is just one of many ads in recent weeks seeking to sway opinions as Congress considers legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, something it currently cannot do.",
      "At the root of the ad’s claim is the way Medicare pays for drugs administered in doctors’ offices. These payments are particularly important to some specialists, including oncologists. Lower prices paid by the government for these drugs also result in less administrative revenue for physician offices.",
      "Oncologists and other specialists provide injections or infusions in a medical office, covered by Part B of Medicare. Medicare reimburses physicians for the cost of the drug based on its average sales price, plus a 6% \"add-on\" payment, which is meant to cover the cost of overhead, staffing and the effort that goes into purchasing the drug. (Pre-pandemic, those payments were reduced to 4.3% under a complicated budget sequester process but were reinstated at the higher level for the duration of the health emergency.)",
      "The percentage-based payment formula has the unintended consequence of incentivizing expensive drugs over lower-cost options: A 6% add-on to a $10,000 drug translates to a lot more money than for a $1,000 drug.",
      "Over the years, pharmaceutical companies and physician groups, including the Community Oncology Alliance, roundly criticized attempts to change the formula and succeeded in killing proposals.",
      "The Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House, would have Medicare negotiate prices for a small number of high-priced drugs, including those used by oncologists under Part B, starting in 2025. At first, only 10 drugs would be selected, and the list would grow to 20 in 2028.",
      "There would be an upper limit on price, called the Maximum Fair Price, which is expected to be lower than average sales prices. That would save Medicare and taxpayers money on those drugs.",
      "Patients, too, might save money because their copays are set as a percentage of the cost of the drug. Oncologists would still get a 6% add-on fee for overhead and administration, but that 6% would be on a lower price, hence the decrease in revenue that concerns the doctors.",
      "We reached out to the Community Oncology Alliance to ask about the ad’s assertions that payments for cancer care would be cut by 45%. It provided a number of reports, including one it commissioned by consulting firm Avalere Health, that calculated the possible revenue loss, and a separate study that tracks mergers, acquisitions, closures and financial matters affecting oncology practices.",
      "For its report, Avalere chose 10 drugs it thought were likely to make the administration’s list, then calculated the likely negotiated price and the resulting add-on payments.",
      "While it varies by specialty, the overall average reduction in add-on revenue would be 39% for those specific 10 drugs, with physician offices seeing a 44.2% drop, and hospitals seeing a 36% decline, said Milena Sullivan, a principal with the health policy team at Avalere and the report’s lead author.\nBut the wording in the ad — \"payments for cancer care will be slashed by close to 45%\" — glosses over the specifics of that finding. It seems to suggest overall revenue for community cancer clinics would be cut 45%, whereas the reduction identified in the study affects only a segment of their revenue: the add-on payments for some of the drugs that clinics and physicians provide.\n\"They commissioned an analysis that did not look at the total impact on community oncology practice finances. They looked just at drugs affected, which wildly inflates impact,\" said Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and an expert on drug costs.\nWithout details on what percentage of a practice’s revenue comes from the add-on payments for a specific set of drugs that has yet to be defined, \"we don’t know how much this is going to reduce oncologists’ income,\" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow in health care policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nTed Okon, executive director for the alliance, defended the wording, saying, \"You can only say so much in an ad.\"\n\"Those are the biggest drugs out there,\" Okon said. \"If you take a hit of 42.9% on 70% of your practice, or even 60%, you are dead in the water.\"\nHowever, the alliance didn’t have specific data on the overall percentage of revenue that the add-on payments represent."

      "Is Grothman correct? Generally speaking, yes. But there is considerable information missing.",
      "Let’s start with the first part of the claim. Did Biden block travel from eight countries upon the discovery of the Omicron variant?",
      "According to a Nov. 26, 2021 proclamation, travelers from eight African countries were indeed blocked from entry into the U.S. to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Those countries were  Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The travel restrictions do not apply to U.S. citizens, however.",
      "In his proclamation, Biden says the travel advisory is necessary to protect the U.S., because African countries had not yet been able to conduct genomic sequencing on the variant to detect how much more transmissible it may be.",
      "So that part of the claim is on point.",

The memo also noted that the DHS does not have the authority to enforce testing procedures at the border, either.",

      "McGuire, however, is citing a \"predicted number\" from the CDC - a monthly estimate the agency produces for each state because drug deaths often require lengthy investigations before being confirmed, creating a backlog.",
      "The CDC estimates that Virginia’s actual yearly overdose deaths rose from 1,669 during the year ending in April 2020 to 2,262 in the year ending in April 2021. That 35.5% increase  jibes with McGuire’s statement.",
      "Nationally, the CDC estimates that drug deaths rose nationally by 28.5%, from 78,056 in the 12 months preceding April 2020 to 100,306 during the year ending in April 2021.",

During Dec. 3 remarks on the most recent jobs report, Biden said that some of the economic achievements on his watch have allowed Americans to keep a step ahead of inflation.",
      "\"Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year,\" Biden said.",
      "To zero in on how much Americans have \"in their pockets\" despite inflation, we turned to a statistic calculated by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis: Per capita, inflation-adjusted disposable personal income. When we inquired, the White House confirmed to PolitiFact that this was the statistic Biden had in mind.",
      "Disposable personal income refers to wage and salary income, plus government transfer payments like Social Security and unemployment insurance, minus taxes. It’s the net of what Americans have left over to pay for all of their needs after they’ve paid their taxes. The figure we used is adjusted for inflation and calculated on a per capita — that is, a per person — basis.",
      "During the coronavirus pandemic, this metric has been unusually volatile. That’s because the federal government enacted several massive bills that provided cash payments, expanded unemployment insurance, business loans, and liberalized child tax credits to help the nation cope with an unprecedentedly sudden economic shutdown after the virus emerged.",
      "In the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 — the quarters that included some of the most intensive federal relief efforts, including the cash payments — personal disposable income rose significantly higher than usual. Smaller but tangible bumps were also evident in the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021.",
      "Beyond these anomalous quarters, though, the data shows that personal disposable income has risen fairly steadily since the first quarter of 2016.",
      "This means that, even setting aside the unusually high quarters, per-capita, inflation-adjusted personal disposable income was higher in the third quarter of 2021 — at $47,188 — than it was in the fourth quarter of 2020, when it was $46,682, as well as every month prior to the pandemic. (These are \"annualized\" rates, which means that the amount of disposable income for a quarter is multiplied by four, to show what it would look like over the course of a whole year.)",
      "One way to look at this is that we’re simply following the gentle upswing in personal disposable income that’s been underway for years. But economists say that would be misleading, since staying on that trend line was no foregone conclusion once the pandemic hit.",
      "\"It's honestly quite surprising to look at the personal income data and not see a deep gash in income,\" George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair said. \"To continue a long-term trend of growing personal income when the economy was getting hammered is a pretty impressive feat of policy.\"",
      "To see a decline in gross domestic product of more than 30% between the first and second quarters of 2020 is akin to \"a Great Depression in one quarter,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. \"But there was enough cash coming out of the government that you don’t see it in the personal disposable income data. It’s stunning.\"",
      "Part of the reason for larger disposable incomes is government payments, but another part is that Americans were unable to spend what they would have on many services, including restaurants and tourism during the pandemic.",
      "One clear sign of that is the personal saving rate. For four years prior to the pandemic, personal saving as a percentage of disposable income usually hovered between 7% and 9%. But after the pandemic struck, it initially spiked to 26% and has remained higher than the pre-pandemic average ever since."

      "This reality has led some Democrats to call for either ending the filibuster or at least carving out an exception to the filibuster rules to be used when considering voting-related legislation. Democrats argue that election rules are such a core facet of democracy that their protection shouldn’t be able to be blocked by a minority of senators.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said she’d personally favor ending the filibuster. But she also made a case to senators who are more protective of the filibuster: that a carve-out for voting rights would be justified, based on historical precedent.",

      "We immediately thought of a few examples of such carve-outs. They include executive-branch and judicial confirmations — notably, for Supreme Court nominees — which have shifted to simple-majority passage during the past decade. We also thought of budget reconciliation rules, which allow a simple majority to pass fiscal-related bills that follow a congressionally passed budget blueprint. (The Biden administration was able to pass the American Rescue Plan, a coronavirus relief bill, using reconciliation earlier this year, and it hopes to do the same with the Build Back Better bill that expands the social safety net.)",

      "As support for the statistic she offered on \"Meet the Press,\" Klobuchar’s office pointed to research by Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. Specifically, Klobuchar’s office pointed to data from a chapter in Reynolds’ 2017 book, \"Exceptions to the Rule: The Politics of Filibuster Limitations in the U.S. Senate.\"",

      "Not all carve-outs are equal. Reynolds said that many of the exceptions, such as those involving arms sales to foreign countries, are not as sweeping and significant a category as voting rights.",
      "\"In some cases, very similar procedures are counted separately,\" Reynolds told PolitiFact. For instance, she said, the Arms Export Control Act has several related but distinct exceptions for measures on reviewing proposed arms sales. Reynolds counted each of these as separate exceptions, but she said one could reasonably group them together, producing a much smaller number of exceptions than 161.",
      "In addition, many of the simple-majority provisions that make up that total \"simply force symbolic votes rather than making actual policy changes,\" she said.",
      "Finally, some of the 161 provisions have never become operational, while others were designed to be temporary and have lapsed.",
      "In order to enact a voting-rights carve-out, senators would have to use the same process that was used to make judicial and executive branch appointments simple-majority votes during the past decade. It’s a multi-step process that has sometimes been called the \"nuclear option.\"",
      "Essentially, the majority leader would need to offer a \"point of order\" stating that a simple-majority vote is called for on the current question. This would be rejected by the chair based on precedent, then immediately appealed. This would trigger a simple-majority vote on whether to overturn the chair’s ruling. Once that simple majority is achieved, the new vote threshold would become the precedent going forward.",
      "While Democrats don’t yet have the 51 votes to support a carve-out for voting rights, this scenario is the most realistic one for them to use to create a simple-majority vote for voting rights.",
      "However, this was not the process used for the vast majority of the 161 prior examples.",
      "Rather, most of those 161 examples were created by passage and enactment of a statute, or ordinary law. This means that, at some point, most of these 161 exceptions themselves had to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate."

      "Scott’s office said in a Dec. 7 press release that he had sent a letter to Florida hospitals \"warning them of the dangerous provision within Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending bill that includes $34.5 billion in cuts to Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments (DSH) and states’ Uncompensated Care Pool (UCP) programs.\"",
      "\"These programs are used to fund charity care by hospitals for patients who are uninsured and underinsured,\" the release said.",
      "Scott’s claim is accurate about the size of proposed cuts to charity care programs, but it provides an incomplete picture of the bill’s impact on health funding. He leaves out the estimated $43.8 billion in the Build Back Better Act to give private health insurance to the people who would have been covered under Medicaid expansion — money that would presumably reduce the need for federal spending on charity care.",
      "\"Claiming that the Build Back Better Act would slash charity funds without accounting for increased spending that would expand coverage, and so decrease the need for such charity funds, is misleading,\" said David Gamage, professor of health policy law at the University of Indiana.",
      "For decades, Medicaid has sent federal money to the states to help so-called disproportionate share hospitals. These are hospitals that treat especially large numbers of people without insurance or who are on Medicare or Medicaid.",
      "Washington also offered another pot of money that tackled the same problem for states that get permission to create their own uncompensated-care pools.",
      "For the 12 states that did not accept federal money to expand Medicaid eligibility, the Build Back Better Act would reduce the money for both programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2031, the total reduction will be about $34.5 billion. That’s the cut Scott cites.",
      "But the proposed cut in hospital aid wouldn’t take place in a vacuum. It is part of a strategy to insure people who have fallen through the cracks of government insurance programs. These are people who make too much or otherwise don’t qualify for Medicaid in their state, yet are too poor to qualify for the premium tax credits through the Affordable Care Act exchanges, which are available only to people above the poverty line.",
      "When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, the idea was that between subsidized private-insurance premiums and making Medicaid available to more people, just about every legal resident would have access to some kind of insurance. (Adults living in the country without permission are not covered.) That assumed that every state would take advantage of federal help to expand Medicaid. When the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out, that created a group of people caught in the middle.",
      "These are people whose incomes are below the poverty line — many work in low-wage jobs — but they don’t qualify for their state’s Medicaid program because they make too much or don't have children. And they don’t qualify for subsidized private insurance, because the way the law was written, people below the federal poverty line aren’t eligible. Today, an estimated 2.2 million people fall in this gap.",
      "Closing the gap has been a Democratic focus for some time. The Build Back Better Act aims to do so by steering more money to private insurance subsidies.",
      "In its first four years, the Build Back Better Act would provide $59.3 billion to subsidize private insurance through the exchanges for the people caught in the gap. The aid ends in 2026.",
      "Over the same period, it would reduce hospital aid by $13.9 billion. With more insured people, the reasoning goes, hospitals would need less money to cover uncompensated charity care.",
      "This trade-off is not a new idea. Melinda Buntin, formerly at the Congressional Budget Office and now a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, said it was written into the Affordable Care Act, even if repeatedly deferred. The law took the linkage for granted.",
      "\"The ACA clearly cut Disproportionate Share payments in anticipation of hospitals seeing fewer uninsured patients,\" Buntin said.",
      "Many studies show that when states expanded Medicaid, their hospitals benefited because they were treating fewer people without insurance.",
      "A review of those studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Medicaid expansion \"contributed to increased hospital revenue overall.\" Medicaid might not fully reimburse a hospital for its costs, but even partial coverage was better than no payment at all.",
      "For the most part, hospitals saw a drop in the level of uncompensated care. However, the foundation’s review noted that some hospitals did better than others. One study found that \"only hospitals in non-metropolitan areas and small hospitals experienced improved profit margins.\"",
      "In short, expanded insurance helps in general, but it is trickier to predict the impact on any particular hospital.",
      "Ideally, the number of uninsured people would drop before hospitals saw their federal compensation decline. The Build Back Better Act tries to account for that."

Democrats said then that Republicans voted to end Medicare, earning PolitiFact’s 2011 Lie of the Year designation, although PolitiFact noted that Democrats’ assertion that the Republican plan would privatize Medicare was Mostly True.",

      "It turns out that, after taxes, corporate profits did hit a 70-year high last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, citing U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. But economists say Smith’s tweet gives a misleading impression about the prices of gas, groceries and medicine.",
      "The prices of various goods have climbed as demand has increased for limited supply. Despite that, companies have been able to keep profit margins high by cutting costs and passing higher costs along to consumers, Reuters reported in September.",

They show that corporate profits in the quarter ending Sept. 30 tallied $2.7 trillion dollars, the highest level since 1950.

      "As the omicron variant of COVID-19 rapidly made its way around the world — infiltrating 89 countries within three weeks of first being identified in late November — it became the fastest-spreading variant since the start of the pandemic.",
      "\"Omicron is now the fastest-spreading virus known to humankind,\" began one three-minute Facebook video. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)",
      "There is more than one way to quantify virus’ spread: One is to measure how easily a virus is transmitted from person to person, and another is to look at how quickly it spreads across the world. When it comes to the former, measles is the fastest. For the latter, it’s omicron.",
      "The omicron variant ranks as a close second, though: Each person who contracts omicron can infect between 7 and 14 people in an unvaccinated, unprotected population, studies show.",
      "One term scientists use to quantify infectious disease outbreaks is R0, pronounced \"R naught,\" and called the basic reproduction number. It indicates the average number of times one person will transmit the virus to someone else in a population where no one has been exposed to or vaccinated against the disease, and is therefore a more theoretical measure.",
      "The basic reproduction number for measles is between 12 and 18. For COVID-19, the basic reproduction number has increased with each strain of the virus. With the original strain, each sick person likely would infect between two and three others; with the delta variant, between five and seven; and with omicron, most estimates put it at 1.5 to 2 times more than delta. That means with omicron, each sick person infects between 7 and 14 people.",
      "Another mathematical measure for the spread of infection is called Rt, which is the effective reproduction number. It takes into account factors such as vaccination levels and immunity from prior exposure and \"is likely lower than the basic reproduction number,\" according to the Health Lab. The Rt value is more of a real-time representation of what a virus’ infection rate is.",
      "The effective reproduction number is measured during an ongoing pandemic, and for COVID-19, it also has varied for each strain of the virus. With the original strain, each sick person would infect around 2.5 others; with the delta variant, it was 3.5 to 4; and with omicron, scientists have estimated it between 3.7 and 4.2.",
      "When measuring how fast a virus spreads around the world, \"Omicron is certainly the most rapidly spreading virus among the ones we have been able to investigate at this level of detail,\" William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told El Pais, a newspaper in Spain, in an interview.",
      "Hanage told PolitiFact that’s because even though each measles infection causes more secondary infections in an unprotected population, it takes longer than omicron to do so. The time it takes one person infected with the omicron variant to infect another person — called the generation time — is shorter than with measles, in a non-immune population."

      "First, Build Back Better would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years, not $4 trillion.",
      "As for how much it devotes to welfare, that’s difficult to say, because there’s no clear definition of welfare. The bill would raise spending for social safety-net programs, including for low-income people, but it also includes $555 billion to fight climate change, nearly a third of the total.",

When contacted by PolitiFact Iowa, Reynold’s communications director, Alex Murphy, wrote in an email that the entire $210 million in new money was from the American Rescue Plan.",
      "The Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant is part of the Empower Rural Iowa initiative, which Reynolds established by an executive order in 2018. In that year, the state allocated $1.3 million to the program. Since 2018, the goals of the grant program have been to reduce the amount of areas in Iowa unserved or underserved by broadband service by providing funds to organizations installing broadband infrastructure.",
      "Reynolds renewed another round of grants on April 28, 2021, after the bill passed unanimously in the Republican-led Legislature earlier that year. Iowa’s state budget allocated $100 million for the program in fiscal 2022, which started July 1, 2021. Reynolds originally had asked for $150 million annually for each of the next three years, but agreed to $100 million, saying she could get federal funds to supplement the remaining cost.",

The state had received 178 applications requesting a total of $300 million in funds.",
      "Reynolds announced the recipients of nearly $100 million using state funds in September. Eventually, the American Rescue Plan amount for Iowa rose to $210 million.",
      "Democrats were quick to respond in October because Reynolds advocated against the passage of the American Rescue Plan before President Biden signed the bill in March. In February, she had signed a joint statement with 21 other governors opposing the plan. The statement criticized the plan because it allocates funds according to each state’s unemployed population rather than its total population, which Reynolds said punished states that kept unemployment levels low in the pandemic.

Voter turnout in the off-year 2019 election reached 359,000. The 2021 total amounted to a little fewer than 20% of eligible voters — not great for elections Pate says are important because of their local impact, but an improvement from when city and school elections were held separately, Kevin Hall, Pate’s spokesperson, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. Before a change in Iowa law, effected in 2019, Iowa school board elections were held in September during odd-numbered years.",
      "Some context is needed for the 2020 election turnout, because Iowans had more options for casting votes than in previous years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, election officials sent absentee ballot request forms to every active registered voter in Iowa that year for what Pate said were safety concerns during the pandemic. County election officials used drop-box guidelines to ensure that absentee votes were cast. Rules for drop-offs varied county to county before the 2021 law enacted uniform rules.",

They could not have been further from the truth.",
      "Hall said Iowa does not have statewide data on people turned away for failing to have an identification card. The state gives registered voters who don't have an Iowa driver’s license or other picture identification free Voter ID PIN cards and allows another person to attest to the voter’s identity, he said. The law began with a soft rollout in 2018, when voters who didn’t have a photo ID signed an oath attesting to their identity, before it was implemented fully in 2019.",
      "Iowans could vote as far out as 29 days before Election Day in 2020, which was fewer than the 40 days allowed in elections up to 2017, the year to which Ernst refers in her newsletter. The national average for early voting in person is 23 days, up one day from what it was nationally in 2021.",
      "The time to cast an absentee ballot in Iowa was shortened by the 2021 election law to 20 days and those ballots now must arrive at the county auditor’s office by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Before the new law, ballots could be counted if postmarked on or before Election Day and arriving at county auditors’ offices by noon the following Monday. County auditors in Iowa reported receiving more than 6,000 Iowa absentee ballots after Election Day in 2020 that counted then but would not under the 2021 law.",

      "In a Feb. 3, 2022 tweet that included a snippet of the floor speech, Grothman made this claim: \"The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not. Meanwhile, @POTUS is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same standards we do at home.\"",
      "\"I feel that many young people are being misled into thinking our country is polluting more than it ever has,\" Grothman said. \"In reality, air and water pollution have decreased significantly in the last 40 years. I also feel that given the growth of the Chinese and Indian economies, people in the U.S. have to be conscious that changes in our laws can inadvertently push jobs to these other countries who do not have the same environmental standards we do.\"",
      "The claim is that the U.S. is ahead of \"other parts of the world\" in terms of the strides it has made. Admittedly, the \"other parts of the world\" is a bit vague, but we interpret it to mean the US is doing better than many other countries that – like it – are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.",
      "When asked for backup, Grothman staffers pointed to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report titled \"Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2020.\"",
      "The report said that CO2 – carbon monoxide – emissions from fossil fuel combustion fell by 8.4% in that 30-year period. Looking at just the 15-year period of 2005 to 2020, they fell 24.7%. (In the final year covered, from 2019 to 2020, the figure was 10.7%)",

In addition, women often seek flexible work schedules, less stressful work environments, and other conditions compatible with meeting the demands of family responsibilities. Those come at a price—namely, lower wages.\"",
      "A 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh also concluded that the wage gap is not simply a product of sexism. CONSAD found that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by other trends common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages, they tend have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men and they tend to have a shorter work history and take more time off from work for childbirth and child care."

    "evidence_full_text": [
      "Delays at the state crime lab have been a front-burner issue every election cycle, including in 2018, when Democrat Josh Kaul won the attorney general’s job on promises to clear a backlog of DNA samples in sexual assault cases.",
      "In an April 14 , 2022, news release, Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney went on to claim that Kaul \"is testing significantly less items than former AG Brad Schimel and is still taking longer to test many categories of key items in comparison to Schimel, including DNA.\"",
      "When asked for data to support his claim, Toney directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to an annual report from Kaul’s own Department of Justice.",
      "We should note that while it’s commonly referred to as the State Crime Lab, there are actually three labs where testing is done – Madison, Milwaukee and Wausau. For our purposes here, we will group them all together.",
      "When looking at overall cases, in 2018, Schimel’s last year, the crime lab took 12,680 cases. In 2021, under Kaul that fell to 9,297 cases – a more than 30% drop.",
      "So Toney is right that Kaul \"is testing significantly less items than former AG Brad Schimel.\"",
      "According to the labs’ 2021 annual report, in the 10 categories analyzed, turnaround took more time in six of them under Kaul than under Schimel.",
      "Let’s start with DNA, since that is what Toney emphasized in his claim.",
      "The report actually breaks down DNA in two areas. DNA analysis involves analyzing and interpreting samples, and comparing them to others. The DNA databank category involves receiving, verifying and analyzing a repository of reference samples.",
      "Before we get started, there is an important nuance to note on the intake and output figures. The output figure can be higher than the input figure, and vice versa, since a sample may come in late one year and not be completed until the next year.",
      "In both DNA areas, under Kaul the crime lab is handling fewer cases and taking longer with them.",
      "In the DNA analysis category, in 2018 the lab had a case intake of 8,626, case output of 5,664 and median turnaround time was 50 days. In 2021, case intake was 3,612, case output was 3,526 and median turnaround was 115 days – more than double.",
      "In the DNA databank category, in 2018 sample intake was 29,900 and turnaround time was 24 days. In 2021 sample intake was 20,736 and median turnaround time was 41 days.",
      "Here are the other five areas where the lab is lagging 2018 numbers:",
      "In the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) category, the quality control figure was 131,412 in 2018 under Schimel and 83,072 in 2021 under Kaul. The system performs comparative analysis of submitted fingerprints, including conducting database searches and provides technical and analytical support to state and federal agencies.",
      "In the controlled substances category, in 2018 case intake was 5,283, case output was 5,422 and median turnaround time was 35 days. In 2021, case intake was 4,430, output was 3,522 and median turnaround time was 49 days.",
      "In firearms, in 2018 case intake was 446, output was 419 with median turnaround time of 87 days. In 2021, case intake was 437, output was 399 and median turnaround time was 104 days.",
      "In toxicology, in 2018 case intake was 3,897, output was 4,051 and median turnaround was 23 days; in 2021 case intake was 4,073, output was 4,078 with median turnaround time of 27 days.",
      "In forensic imaging, in 2018 case intake was 62, output was 59 and median turnaround time was 25 days. In 2021, case intake was 84, output was 71 and median turnaround was 55 days.",
      "So, on those six areas, there generally were fewer cases handled and the median time to complete them was longer, sometimes considerably so. And Toney’s claim was a narrow one – not that turnaround was up in all categories, but in \"many\" categories.",
      "That said, it’s worth noting Kaul did have a better showing in turnaround time in some areas:",
      "For instance, the median turnaround time in the latent prints category was 43 days in 2021, compared to 139 in 2018, under Schimel. In trace evidence, it was 29 days, compared to 58.",
      "Additionally, in the footwear category, Kaul’s median turnaround was 11 days, compared to 134 under Schimel. And in crime scene responses, Kaul did better, with 155 responses to Schimel’s 122."

The database showed that between Sept. 2, 2021 and April 9, 2022, Hochul signed 585 bills, according to a count by the campaign that that PolitiFact confirmed.",
      "It’s true that relative to other state legislatures, the New York State Legislature introduces an uncommonly high number of bills and passes an above-average number of them into law.",
      "New York lawmakers introduce on average almost 16,000 bills a year, the highest among all states, according to an analysis of more than 20 years of data, said Brenda Erickson, a program principal with the National Conference of State Legislatures. Of the thousands that are introduced in New York, an average of about 650 are enacted every year, Erickson said.",
      "By comparison, the national yearly average of bills introduced is 2,200, with 425 bills enacted, she said.",
      "Several reasons account for why so many are introduced in New York, said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University. The legislature has a professional staff, which can work on drafting new laws. The state government also spends more money per person than many other states. New York also has a large state government that runs many programs, and sometimes those operations need adjustments, which can require changes to the law."

      "That small group of the ultrawealthy — made up of Republicans like Dick and Liz Uihlein, whose shipping supply company Uline is headquartered in Wisconsin, and Democrats like former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg — received close to $25 billion in total tax savings in 2018 as a result of the pass-through tax break benefits, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research study.",
      "The rest of the top 10% of Americans by income received a little over $12 billion in total, and everyone else in the country, about $6 billion.",

The Senate had 57 districts in 1970.

      "Stewart-Cousins is correct that Republican leadership in the Senate allowed the bill to come to the floor, though the majority leader at the time, Sen. Earl Brydges of Niagara Falls, was no proponent of abortion. Brydges could have stopped the vote, but he did not. An abortion rights supporter told the New York Times that Brydges miscalculated, that he allowed a vote for a full repeal of the abortion ban, without restrictions, because he did not think it would pass."

Cotton didn’t mention that. (It’s also worth noting that when population is distributed unevenly within a state — as is the case with metropolitan Chicago in the northeast corner of Illinois — the maps will tend to look messier than in states with smaller variances in population.)",

      "Chabot spokesman Brian Griffith walked us through why Chabot asserts the Patriot Act is in play, and we gathered the legal insights of several law professors, including a former federal prosecutor, to help sort out the issues.",
      "On Oct. 4, Garland sent a memo to the FBI, every U.S. attorney and the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.",
      "\"While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views,\" Garland wrote.",

      "Some Republican lawmakers view the National Security Division as a red flag. The division was created by the 2006 reauthorization of the Patriot Act. The change put a number of existing Justice Department offices under one roof. The focus was largely on foreign terrorists, but the original Patriot Act, championed by Republicans, included a definition of domestic terrorism, and that fell within the scope of the new division.",
      "Chabot spokesman Griffith said Garland’s words in his memo about \"threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views,\" mirrors the definition of domestic terrorism in federal law. Specifically, the part in Section 802 that talks about \"acts dangerous to human life,\" designed \"to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion.\"",
      "\"What Attorney General Garland is saying in that first paragraph is that parents are entitled to express their views under the First Amendment, but should they cross the line and either threaten or attempt to intimidate school board members, they may be guilty of the federal crime of domestic terrorism,\" Griffith said. \"And the main federal law utilized in investigating alleged domestic terrorism is the Patriot Act.\"",
      "Griffith noted that the National School Boards Association listed the Patriot Act in its letter to the administration. It was one among many laws the association cited.",
      "For over a decade, the Justice Department has dismissed concerns over the broad domestic use of the Patriot Act. The law would be triggered, the department has said, only if there was \"criminal wrongdoing that could result in death.\"",
      "Law professor and former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman at Columbia University said Griffith overstates the significance of the Patriot Act.",
      "\"The Patriot Act has vanishingly little to do with criminalizing any of this, and is unlikely to provide the legal authority needed to prosecute threats and other forms of intimidation over which DOJ has jurisdiction,\" Richman said. \"A variety of criminal acts that federal enforcers might well categorize as domestic terrorism — because of the motivation or groups involved — are covered by ordinary criminal statutes.\"",
      "A report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, also found that the Patriot Act is far from the main weapon in the legal arsenal.",
      "\"Numerous federal statutes offer prosecutors options in charging violent and destructive conduct,\" the July 2 report said.",
      "William Charles Banks, founding director of Syracuse University’s Institute for Security Policy and Law, said there’s also nothing new about the need to distinguish between expressing deep anger with government workers and making criminal threats.",
      "\"The lines that may be crossed are the same ones that law enforcement has had to observe and navigate for most of the last century, since the U.S. Supreme Court said that the First Amendment protects expressive conduct up to the point that it incentivizes imminent lawless action,\" Banks said. \"Likelihood of violence and imminence of it are the two key factors, and they are always fact-sensitive.\"",
      "Simply put, violence and true threats of violence are against the law, and would be even if the Patriot Act never existed.",
      "Gregory Magarian at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis said Chabot \"stretches the statements in the memo and the press release far past their breaking point.\" Chabot got ahead of himself, Magarian said, because so far the Justice Department has done very little.",
      "\"The memo and press release say nothing about whether the DOJ will take particular actions against particular actors or what those actions might be,\" Magarian said.",

The main problem is that study only went through 2010, and ice losses have accelerated since then. There’s been a steeper and longer lasting decline in recent decades compared with the pre-World War II period Koonin mentioned.",
      "Greenland lost ice faster this decade than 80 years ago. Read the full fact-check in our bio. ##ClimateChange ##LearnOnTikTok",
      "Measuring Greenland’s ice involves much more than just tracking the area it covers. Researchers need to factor in the amount of snowfall that adds to its mass, and weigh that against the millions of gallons of water that evaporate into the atmosphere or melt into the water. Plus, in a process called calving, large chunks break off and drift away as icebergs.",
      "Satellites provide some of the best information to track trends in the ice, but they date back only to the early 1990s. Before then, the best data came from aerial photographs in the 1930s and 1940s. When the underlying terrain is known, scientists compare pictures over the years to tell what happened with the ice.",
      "Using historic air and sea measurements and computer models, researchers can push the estimates of the mass of the ice as far back as the mid-1800s.",
      "Koonin told us that he relied on an article about the role of melting ice on rising sea levels. The August 2020 paper noted two periods when Greenland ice added the most to the oceans — around 1940 and after about 1990.",
      "The highest amount came in 1937 when Greenland’s ice sheet caused the sea level to rise by .76 millimeters. In 2010, the ice sheet added .7 millimeters to the oceans.

In 2012, it shed about 464 gigatons, and in 2019, it lost about 532 gigatons. According to NASA, 1 gigaton of ice would cover Central Park in New York and reach 1,119 feet high.",
      "\"Following a period of relative stability from the 1970s to early 1990s, the ice sheet began losing ice at an accelerating rate and has now experienced annual net ice loss every year since 1998,\" the report said.",
      "Many of the researchers who worked on that analysis were part of a project that pulled together multiple ways of measuring the mass of Greenland’s ice and built a tool that tracks the ice nearly in real time. They made the full data tables available and, with the help of one of those collaborators, Kristian Kjeldsen at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland in Denmark, we summarized the ice loss trends decade by decade.",
      "The overall trend is that losses have been more sustained and deeper than during the pre-WWII period that Koonin referred to in his video.",
      "All studies of the Greenland ice sheet find that the numbers bounce around a lot from year to year. Averages for each decade help smooth out the trends. Even with the best methods, pinpoint accuracy is out of reach, and the shaded areas show the high and low estimates, with the solid line showing the mid-points. The further back in time, the bigger the uncertainty.",
      "\"Some observations point to a warm period in the late 1920s and early 1930s, which coincides with glacier retreat in the southeast,\" Kjeldsen said.",
      "But he noted, after 2000, negative numbers are \"more persistent.\"",
      "The 1930s low point of 206 gigatons of ice sheet loss is not as large as the 247 gigatons average yearly loss between 2010 and 2020.",
      "We counted the years of continuous decline. The current stretch of year-on-year losses since 1998 is the longest this century. (We reworked the yearly numbers several ways, looking at five-year periods and average changes during periods of ice loss. The overall trends remained the same.)",
      "Researcher Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said the tons of ice lost today actually are more significant than losses in the 1930s. Back then, the ice sheet was bigger.",
      "\"After losing ice in the earlier part of the 20th century, the ice sheet did not expand back to its previous mass and shape,\" Moon said. \"So as warming air and ocean temperatures arrived in the later part of the 20th century, the ice loss was picking up from a different starting point.\""

      "People vaccinated against COVID-19 cannot shed spike proteins to harm anyone. Many experts have debunked this notion, saying it is a conspiracy intended to undermine the vaccines. Experts also have said that the spike proteins produced through vaccination cannot infect others.",
      "The blog post says its source is a June 26 article from National Times Australia. That article, in turn, cites a May 4 post on Christians For Truth, which then references the ultimate source of the false information: an April 26 press release from America’s Frontline Doctors. That group has spread misinformation and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that vaccine shedding \"can only occur when a vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus,\" and none of the COVID-19 vaccines in use in the United States meet that description. Other vaccines, such as measles and flu, use a piece or weakened version of the germ that is being vaccinated against.",
      "The spike proteins referenced in the claim occur in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which use mRNA technology. The CDC explains that mRNA vaccines work like this: The vaccine sends instructions to the body’s cells to make a piece of spike protein, which is also found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. The cells make and display the protein, and \"our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it.\" The resulting immune response produces antibodies.",
      "The spike proteins are harmless, do not cause illness and do not last long in the body.",
      "The claim also says that \"Pfizer confirmed\" that people can shed spike proteins, which is unsubstantiated. This part of the claim appears to have originated with an April 29 tweet from Dr. Simone Gold, the founder of America’s Frontline Doctors who also was arrested for actions stemming from her participation in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol."

    "claim": "Federal agents directly incited people on Jan. 6, 2021, and \"intentionally entrapped\" American citizens.",
    "evidence_full_text": [
      "A debunked conspiracy theory that claims federal agents incited the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is making a new appearance in Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s new three-part documentary series, \"Patriot Purge.\"",
      "The controversial series that started airing Nov. 1 attempts to frame the insurrection as a false flag arranged by the federal government to ensnare American citizens who supported former President Donald Trump. The video is available on Fox News’ subscription-based streaming service \"Fox Nation,\" but it’s not being aired on the Fox News channel.",
      "\"Most Americans probably assume the chaos on Jan. 6 was the result of intelligence failures or of simple government incompetence. But direct incitement by federal agents? The intentional entrapment of American citizens? No decent person wants to believe that. But increasingly there’s evidence it is true,\" Carlson claimed at the close of the first segment.",
      "Carlson is wrong. There is no credible evidence behind this theory, and Carlson’s piece doesn’t present any. PolitiFact reached out to Fox News but did not hear back. The FBI declined to comment.",
      "The first time we saw this claim from Carlson, he based it on reporting by Revolver News, a right-leaning website. In a June 14 article, headlined, \"Unindicted Co-Conspirators in 1/6 Cases Raise Disturbing Questions of Federal Foreknowledge,\" Revolver speculated that because there were unindicted, unnamed co-conspirators included in some of the Capitol rioters’ federal charging documents, it was reasonable to assume that those people are FBI informants or agents.",
      "Carlson returned to Revolver as a source for his documentary series, interviewing Darren Beattie, who runs Revolver News and is a former Trump White House speechwriter who was fired in 2018 after he appeared on a panel with a white nationalist. In the video, Beattie made conspiratorial claims connecting the foiled October 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to the notion that the FBI orchestrated the insurrection, because informants and undercover FBI operatives were involved.",
      "Beattie referenced Steven D’Antuono, the former director of the Detroit FBI field office, who was promoted to help lead the FBI’s Washington, D.C., office after his team successfully thwarted the Whitmer kidnapping. D’Antuono is now working on the Capitol riot cases. The film suggested this is suspicious, and Beattie reiterated his website’s reporting that D’Antuono was \"quietly\" promoted. The suggestion ignores that the FBI issued a press release about the news and local media wrote stories about it.",
      "The comparison between Jan. 6 and the Whitmer plot is fraught. The plan in Michigan was never carried out, as is the case with most schemes that involve undercover agents and result in criminal charges.",
      "Carlson cites reporting from journalist Trevor Aaronson on FBI stings that were used to to entrap Muslims after 9/11 to support his theory that the same was done to Trump supporters at the Capitol. But back in June, when Carlson first used Aaronson’s research in one of his segments, Aaronson responded in an article and said the Fox News host distorted his reporting.",
      "\"While it is true that the FBI has since 9/11 set up hundreds of Muslims in counterterrorism stings, providing weapons and sometimes the ideas for plots, I have seen zero evidence to suggest that Jan. 6 was part of a plot engineered by the FBI,\" Aaronson told PolitiFact in an email. \"What's more, the scale of the Capitol riot, involving hundreds of people from all over the country, makes the suggestion that this was some FBI plot absolutely ludicrous.\"",
      "Carlson also claimed that a former DEA agent, Mark Ibrahim, was \"strongly encouraged\" to go inside the Capitol building by an unnamed FBI informant friend who had invited him to the rally. Carlson presents no evidence for this, and court documents show the friend denied urging Ibrahim to go inside. The friend told investigators Ibrahim had concocted the story and went to the rally to promote himself after submitting an intent to resign from the DEA. The witness also told federal agents they were not at the Capitol in any formal capacity for the FBI.",
      "Meanwhile, Ibrahim wasn’t indicted for \"simply being near the Capitol,\" as Carlson asserted in the series. Court documents show Ibrahim faces charges for bringing a firearm onto restricted grounds and for making false statements to federal agents.",
      "Others who appeared in the series claimed that so-called \"professional agitators\" were there that day to tip things into chaos and were seen changing clothes. They pointed to the involvement of John Sullivan, who has been charged in the riot and is one of the only defendants who has been identified as supporting left-wing causes at times. But there is no evidence that Sullivan is connected to antifa, the FBI or the federal government or that he single-handedly caused the riot.",
      "While there may have been individuals who were trying to quell passions, it’s clear from court filings in hundreds of cases that the people who were instigating violence were largely Trump supporters.",
      "In the video, Carlson used other people, some of whom are charged in the riot, to bolster his argument. One person claimed that the Capitol police were simply letting everyone in the building in order to intentionally entrap them. But the film didn’t acknowledge that law enforcement were vastly outnumbered. One officer died the following day, and four more have died since by suicide.",
      "Jesse Norris, a criminal justice professor at the State University of New York at Fredonia who researches entrapment incidents in terrorism prosecutions, told us that in order to show that those charged in Jan. 6 were directly incited or entrapped, Carlson would need to have evidence that undercover police or informants — who were working at the behest of law enforcement at the time — were involved in the planning of violence at the Capitol, or the instigation of violence while the protests were underway.",
      "He would also need to show, Norris added, that the perpetrators were not already predisposed to commit the same crimes without the informants' influence.",
      "\"From a common-sense point of view, they were entrapped if the informants got them to do something they wouldn't have realistically done on their own,\" Norris said."

    "evidence_full_text": [
      "In the first part of Tucker Carlson’s controversial and conspiratorial documentary series attempting to rewrite the events of Jan. 6, the Fox News host claimed that the attack on the U.S. Capitol is being used as a front to justify a \"purge\" of Donald Trump voters and a new war on terror.",
      "The series started airing Nov. 1 on Fox Nation, Fox News’ subscription streaming service. It was produced as part of a multiyear deal Carlson signed to make specials for Fox Nation, and it was co-written by Scooter Downey, who previously directed films for far-right figures. On Fox News’ flagship morning show, \"Fox & Friends,\" Carlson defended the series as \"rock-solid factually.\"",
      "Yet the first installment of the three-part documentary, titled \"Patriot Purge,\" advances several conspiracy theories about the insurrection, including that the violence of the day was spurred on by left-wing instigators and agent provacateurs in disguise, and that the siege may have been a trap orchestrated by the FBI. It also includes sympathetic interviews with conservatives involved in the day’s events, such as \"Stop the Steal\" organizer Ali Alexander.",
      "The film opens with a video montage juxtaposing footage and commentary related to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Abu Ghraib prison, Guantanamo Bay and Islamic terrorism with footage and commentary about Jan. 6 and the government’s prosecution of the rioters. Elijah Schaffer of BlazeTV, a conservative outlet, is heard describing the Jan. 6 charges as \"political persecution.\"",
      "\"The very same corrupt interests in Washington that pushed the Iraq War under false pretenses are now pushing the lie of a domestic white terror. They are tying white nationalist terrorism to Trump voters. They’re tying Jan. 6 to 9/11. They’re tying millions of law abiding Americans to al-Qaida and ISIS. Jan. 6 is being used as a pretext to strip millions of Americans — disfavored Americans — of their core constitutional rights, and to defame them as domestic terrorists.\"",
      "Carlson provided no evidence to explain how \"millions of Americans\" are getting stripped of their \"core constitutional rights.\" Regardless, the claim is far from accurate. And the hundreds of charges brought after Jan. 6 were handed down to people who broke laws as they stormed the Capitol, clashed with police and disrupted congressional proceedings in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results. Most were Trump supporters.",
      "\"I’m not aware of anyone being stripped of constitutional rights because of alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, let alone ‘millions’ of people,\" said David Alan Sklansky, professor of law and faculty co-director of the Criminal Justice Center at Stanford Law School.",
      "Nine months after the violent and deadly attack, the Justice Department has arrested about 650 people for involvement, including on charges related to destroying or stealing property, carrying firearms or other weapons, assaulting officers, obstructing official proceedings, and conspiracy. The case details are often spelled out in publicly available arrest warrants turned over to judges.",
      "More than 85% of those people were charged in part using evidence from their own or others’ social media accounts, according to George Washington University. Some live streamed their participation in the day’s events, while others defended or boasted about it on social media.",
      "The riot also included members of some white supremacist groups, along with members of far-right extremist militia organizations like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.",
      "But there’s no evidence that anywhere close to the 74 million people who voted in 2020 for Trump have been stripped of constitutional rights post-Jan. 6. An estimated 2,000 to 2,500 people entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to the Washington Post. One- to two-thirds of them, then, have not been arrested. And among those who have, the arrests haven’t extended beyond the people who were involved that day.",
      "Even among those charged, there’s no evidence that their constitutional rights are under threat, said Michael Jensen, a senior researcher at the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. \"Nor are there any legal proceedings, legislative debates, or law enforcement actions underway that could result in that outcome.\"",

      "Claims regarding the supposed success of ivermectin in preventing COVID-19 in India have been around for months, and have recently popped up again as India’s case numbers subside. India stopped recommending the use of ivermectin for management of the virus in September, citing a lack of scientific evidence of its benefits.",
      "In the U.S. The FDA has approved ivermectin for use in humans for treating such things as parasitic worms, head lice and rosacea, but advises against taking it to prevent or treat the coronavirus.",
      "Uttar Pradesh, which is India’s most populous state, with more than 200 million people, reported on Nov. 7 that it had just 85 active COVID cases, according to the Times of India. More than 67% of the eligible population had received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 22% were fully vaccinated. The government has credited its success to using ivermectin as a preventive measure, according to an article in the Indian Express in May.",
      "But is their low case count credible? And does it have anything to do with ivermectin?",
      "We spoke with Dr. Lee Riley, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of California Berkeley, who said that there is no peer-reviewed randomized control study that shows that ivermectin is the reason why cases are going down in Uttar Pradesh. Any study would have to include a placebo group, and control for other measures, such as use of masks and social distancing, which Uttar Pradesh was using, he said.",
      "Confirmed COVID cases are down in India, and in other places, Riley said, but he questioned how widely Uttar Pradesh is testing. If there are fewer tests, there will be fewer recorded cases.",
      "Asked about claims that Uttar Pradesh’s low case numbers were due to ivermectin, Riley said said that there would be no biological reason why the drug would be effective at preventing the disease, but not in treating it, as studies have shown. No other place in the world has shown that ivermectin is effective at preventing COVID-19, Riley said.",
      "Another medical doctor has researched claims of ivermectin’s success, both scientific and anecdotal, and found them lacking.",
      "Dr. Nick Mark, who works with critical care and pulmonary patients at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, has examined claims that ivermectin has had dramatic success in Uttar Pradesh.",

    "evidence_full_text": [
      "For many months, vaccine skeptics have been sounding false alarms about the effect of COVID-19 vaccines on pregnancy and fertility.",
      "Concerns about the risk of spontaneous abortion, also known as miscarriage, have resurfaced following a November report in Science, Public Health Policy & the Law, a journal run by James Lyons-Weiler.",
      "\"Report Finds Increased Risk of Spontaneous Abortion Following COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy,\" reads the headline on a post from Lyons-Weiler, who seeks to summarize the report’s findings. \"Epidemiologists Find CDC Study Contains Major Error.\"",
      "Lyons-Weiler, whose claims about COVID-19 we have previously fact-checked, claims in his piece that the authors of the report found a \"major error\" in a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June. The miscarriage rate, the authors asserted, was seven to eight times higher than the CDC study presented.",
      "The authors' calculations, however, misrepresent the CDC study findings by manipulating and cherry-picking data, using a similar method to previously circulating claims on social media about the same CDC study.",
      "The authors of the original CDC study, titled \"Preliminary Findings of mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant Persons,\" used data from three federal reporting systems monitoring vaccine safety. They contacted 3,958 people enrolled in one of these systems about three months after they had received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "Of those people, 712 had given birth to healthy babies, 104 experienced miscarriages and one had a stillbirth. Ten people had ectopic pregnancies or induced abortions. The remaining 3,131 participants were either still pregnant or had not yet completed follow-up.",
      "They found 104 miscarriages out of 827 completed pregnancies, which divides to a 12.6% miscarriage rate — comparable with the average miscarriage rate of 12.5% to 18.7% in the general population.",
      "The authors of the report in Lyon-Weiler's journal claim that this figure is incorrect, presenting alternative calculations that result in a much higher miscarriage rate of 82% to 91%.",
      "They arrived at these figures by using the same flawed method that was used in social media posts that we saw circulating in July. Those posts, which we fact-checked, had excluded 700 people vaccinated in the third trimester, when fetuses are more developed and the risk of miscarriage is reduced. Likewise, the authors excluded 700 people who were vaccinated after 20 weeks of pregnancy, the cutoff period that defines miscarriage. This left just 127 completed pregnancies. The 104 miscarriages out of 127 pregnancies amounted to 82%.",
      "This 82%, however, is not the miscarriage rate. Determining the effects of vaccination early in pregnancy means looking only at people who were vaccinated before 20 weeks, but it’s misleading to apply the narrow denominator of 127 to the preliminary data in the NEJM paper.",
      "\"[Y]ou can’t do that because the data set is looking at all pregnancy outcomes,\" said Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN, in a blog post. \"Of course when you remove those 700 pregnancies the miscarriage rate looks artificially high, because the only way a person got into the data set … was if the pregnancy had ended and they had been vaccinated.\"",
      "Likewise, the upper range of their estimate, 91%, used a denominator that only counted people with loss of pregnancy. This included 104 people who had spontaneous abortions and 10 people who had ectopic pregnancies or induced abortions, essentially dividing the number of miscarriages by itself. Determining the frequency of a certain outcome (i.e., miscarriages) using a sample that grossly overrepresents that outcome necessarily produces an inflated figure that cannot be applied to the general population.",
      "A more precise assessment of whether vaccination before the third trimester increases miscarriage rates would require following these pregnancies to completion. \"These pregnancies will eventually form the denominator to look at vaccination in the first and second trimesters, but these pregnancies have to end and all data needs to be collected before they can be used,\" said Gunter.",
      "\"There is no conspiracy to hide miscarriages here, just an abuse of statistics,\" said Gunter."
