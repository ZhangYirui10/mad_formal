The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japan’s emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while India’s emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons.\nChart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan)\nSullivan’s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan’s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.",

(Office of Dan Sullivan)\nSullivan’s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan’s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%."

Of those, a majority, 57.3%, said they \"strongly support\" voter identification requirements and 12.5% said they \"somewhat support\" such requirements. Overall, 69.8% of  respondents expressed some level of support for requiring voter identification.\nThe poll showed 27.7% of respondents opposed it. Of those, 20.5% said they \"strongly oppose\" and 7.2 % said they \"somewhat oppose\" it. The rest of those polled said they didn’t know or refused to answer.\nAmong Republicans, 98% supported it. Among non-affiliated voters, 82% supported it. Among Democrats, 49% supported. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points, so support among Democrats could be 53%, or it could be 45%.\nSupport for the measure was strong upstate and downstate. Majorities of all racial groups polled also supported it,  ranging from 91% in support among Asian respondents to 58% among Black respondents.\nThirty-seven percent of poll respondents live upstate, and 63% live downstate. Respondents were a mix of party affiliations: 31% percent Republican, 52% percent Democratic or Working Families, and 18% non-affiliated or who refused to answer.\nSeventy-two percent of respondents were white, 10% were Hispanic, 12% were Black, and 4% were Asian.",

      "In August,PolitiFact looked at new voter identification lawsand found broad public support for voter identification laws, even among Democrats. PolitiFact also found nuance in the debate, and that asking people whether they support or oppose these laws obscure these aspects. These include voter identification requirements already in place, thelow risk of voter fraud, and the support even among voting rights advocates for voter identification laws that are flexible enough to accommodate all voters. States set their own rules on voter identification. Some are strict, and others less so, accepting many different forms of identification to vote.",

A majority in both parties support it: 93% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats. In March, anAssociated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research pollfound that 72% of respondents strongly or somewhat favor requiring photo identification to vote.",

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan)\nSullivan’s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan’s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.",

In the 10 largest states, New York has the second-highest rate of vaccination in children ages 5 to 11, after Illinois, when children who have had at least one dose of the vaccine are counted. Forty-one percent of children in this age group have had at least one dose in New York. The figure is 42% in Illinois.",
      "We consulted data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which issues Covid-19 reports for each state. A report from Feb. 25 showed that 33.5% of children ages 5 to 11 and 71.2% of children ages 12 to 17 were fully vaccinated in New York State. Among large states, Illinois had a greater share of children ages 5 to 11 who were fully vaccinated, at 34.8%. Among children ages 12 to 17 in large states, New York had the largest share.",
      "For vaccinations, states typically require that parents actively consent before their minor children can be immunized. Such consent requirements usually take the form of the parent providing verbal or written permission, though there are exceptions — for children who have been emancipated or who don’t live with a parent or guardian, for example. The age of consent for vaccinations varies by state, though most states put it at 18, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",

      "In New York, parental consent for kids 16 and 17 can be given in person, over the phone and sometimes in a written statement. For kids 5-15, an adult caregiver also should be present for the  vaccination. Implied consent is not an option.",

In \"phase 1b,\" vaccines would be reserved for people 75 years and older and \"frontline essential workers\" outside of the health care context, a number estimated to total 49 million. In \"phase 1c,\" the vaccine would be given to people between 65 and 74 years, or younger people with certain \"high-risk medical conditions,\" totaling about 129 million people.",

The agency also reports that between Dec. 14, 2020, and Nov. 29, 2021, VAERS received 10,128 reports of deaths among people who were vaccinated — that figure would represent 0.0022% of vaccinated people.",

      "Though the vaccine dosage for children ages 5 to 11 is a third of that given to those 12 and up, data from the Pfizer study shows that its vaccine is 90.7% effective at preventing COVID-19, with similar safety levels and side effects as older age groups.",
