The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan\u2019s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%.

        "reported U.S. emergency oil reserves dropped to 434.1 million barrels, their lowest level since October 1984",
        "Hudson\u2019s tweet raises three questions: Did Biden cause a rise in gas\u00a0prices and an energy crisis? Did Biden drain the strategic petroleum reserve to its lowest level since 1983? And has that been Biden\u2019s \"only response\" to what Hudson says described as an \"energy crisis\"?",
        "said the Biden administration\u2019s record release of oil was intended to lower rising energy costs as Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted supply.",
        "180 million barrels of oil from the reserve. Republicans accused Biden of",
        "Hudson is right about the levels of the U.S. oil reserve. They\u2019re at the lowest level in about 40 years.",

On Nov. 23, 2021, Biden ordered the release of some 50 million barrels of oil from the reserve, or roughly two and a half days of U.S. demand. It was only the fourth time a president had done so. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush released reserves as the Persian Gulf War threatened the international oil market. In 2005, President George W. Bush did it after Hurricane Katrina destroyed oil infrastructure on the Gulf coast. And in 2011, President Barack Obama did it during the civil war in Libya, which prompted concerns about international supply disruptions.",
