    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that gas prices were WAY higher in 2008 under Republican president George W. Bush. While it is true that gas prices were higher in 2008, the claim is exaggerated. According to the evidence, the national average cost for a gallon of gas in the U.S. was $4.11 in July 2008, which is indeed higher than the current prices. However, the claim also implies that gas prices were higher under Bush's entire presidency, which is not accurate. The evidence shows that gas prices were affected by external factors such as the 9/11 attacks and the 2008 mortgage crisis, which led to a decline in gas prices towards the end of Bush's term. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also misleading."

However, it is unclear whether he has spoken out specifically about violent summer protests in North Carolina. The evidence does mention protests in Raleigh and Winston, but it does not provide direct evidence that Stein has spoken out about them. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as Stein has taken some actions related to the Jan. 6 protests, but the claim's assertion that he has said nothing about violent summer protests is not supported by the evidence."

While the Justice Department has not labeled parents who speak out at school board meetings as domestic terrorists, some lawmakers and media outlets have made claims that the department is treating parents who express concerns about school curriculum as domestic terrorists. However, the evidence suggests that the Justice Department has not invoked the Patriot Act against parents who simply express their views or raise concerns about school curriculum. The department has clarified that parents have the right to express their views under the First Amendment, but may be guilty of domestic terrorism if they cross the line and threaten or attempt to intimidate school board members. The evidence also suggests that the Justice Department has not used the Patriot Act to investigate or prosecute parents who simply speak out at school board meetings.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Democrats are \"asking for a blank check book to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions\" is partially true. While Democrats have proposed large spending bills, such as the Build Back Better Act, which has a price tag of over $3 trillion, they have also proposed various measures to ensure accountability and transparency in government spending. For example, the bill includes provisions for regular reporting and oversight of spending, as well as measures to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Additionally, Democrats have also proposed increasing funding for programs that benefit low- and moderate-income families, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, which are designed to help alleviate poverty and promote economic mobility. However, it is also true that some Democrats have been criticized for their spending proposals, and some have argued that they do not provide sufficient details on how the money will be spent.

Additionally, the evidence suggests that this is not a typical or everyday application, but rather a niche solution for emergency or temporary situations. The claim also implies that luxury EVs will be recharged using diesel generators, which is not supported by the evidence.

The claim that vaccinated people are the real threat to unvaccinated people is not supported by any credible evidence and is likely a misinformation or conspiracy theory. The evidence suggests that the main threat to unvaccinated people is other unvaccinated people, as stated by multiple sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Additionally, the data shows that unvaccinated people are at a higher risk of severe illness and death compared to vaccinated individuals, which further supports the fact that unvaccinated people are the ones at greater risk, not the other way around."

The same moment is visible in an MSNBC video from the scene. Additionally, the photo was not altered to make it look like the Capitol was on fire, as claimed. Instead, it accurately captures the scene at the time, with smoke billowing and rioters in silhouette.

While there have been reports of unsolicited packages containing face masks, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that these masks are laced with a toxic substance. The evidence suggests that these packages are likely part of a \"brushing\" scam, where sellers send unsolicited items to addresses they find online to post fake positive reviews and improve their ratings. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the masks themselves are toxic. The claim has been partially debunked by fact-checking organizations such as Snopes, which found that the claim of an irritant in the masks in 2020 was unverified. While it is possible that some packages may contain harmful substances, there is no evidence to support the claim that this is a widespread or intentional practice by scam artists."

While the evidence suggests that North Carolina did experience a significant increase in gas prices, the exact figure of 14 cents per gallon is not consistently supported by the evidence. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, stated that the average gas price in North Carolina rose 15 cents per gallon, and AAA did not single out North Carolina as having the largest increase in gas prices. However, North Carolina's average price increase between Oct. 17 and Oct. 24 was the largest of any state tracked by GasBuddy.com.

He was mocking this claim, saying that the government would not be able to find out who owns a gun and would not seize them. The full context of his statement is that he was debunking the NRA's claims, not making a threat himself.

The claim is based on a review article that warns about the potential risks of long-term use of masks, especially for children, adolescents, and pregnant women, due to the buildup of carbon dioxide. However, the article does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes \"dangerous\" levels of carbon dioxide. The article also notes that the data on testicular toxicity in adolescents is limited and inconclusive.\n\nMoreover, the claim is exaggerated and sensationalized, as it implies that any carbon dioxide concentration above 2,000 parts per million is automatically \"dangerous.\" In reality, the article is warning about the potential risks of long-term use of masks, not the immediate effects of carbon dioxide exposure. Additionally, the article does not provide evidence that carbon dioxide concentrations above 2,000 parts per million are universally \"dangerous\" for all individuals.\n\nTherefore, while the claim is based on some scientific evidence, it is misleading and lacks context, and its accuracy is limited.

The evidence includes statements from researchers such as Twila Moon, who notes that the tons of ice lost today are more significant than losses in the 1930s, and NASA's data showing record ice loss in 2019. Additionally, the evidence shows that the ice sheet has been losing mass at an accelerating rate in recent decades, with the 2010s being the decade with the highest average yearly loss.

The agreement aimed to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan by May 2021, and Biden's administration followed through on this plan.

The video is from a helicopter tour company in Miami, and the ship's origin is not mentioned.

While there are reports of voters being turned away and told they requested absentee ballots, the evidence suggests that this may be due to a mix-up caused by a new law that made annual absentee ballot requests permanent, rather than a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise voters. Additionally, the Virginia Department of Elections has not received any reports related to the account, and some voters have reported being able to resolve the issue by signing affidavits stating they did not request absentee ballots.

Iceland has not completely suspended the use of Moderna, and Finland has only limited its use for men and boys under 30, not everyone under 30. Sweden has temporarily suspended the use of Moderna for people born in 1991 or later, and Norway has recommended Pfizer over Moderna for certain individuals.

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim is partially true. The evidence shows that China and India are leading in terms of the absolute change in carbon dioxide emissions since 1990, but not in terms of per capita emissions. The chart shared on Facebook and used by Sen. Dan Sullivan shows the percentage change in CO2 emissions, which makes it appear as though China and India are leading. However, when looking at the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons, the US and Japan lead. Additionally, the evidence highlights that China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, which means their emissions have grown a lot since then. On the other hand, the US, UK, Germany, and Japan already had high levels of emissions in 1990, which didn't change much over the same period.

Roger Williams. The report and the spokesperson's statement both mention the projected increase in residential non-renewable energy expenditures, which is estimated to be around $18 billion (in 2020 dollars) or $19 billion (in 2018 dollars). The speech by Rep. Williams also mentions the same figure.

According to the evidence, the payroll and federal income taxes paid by low-wage workers can exceed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) they receive, resulting in a net tax burden that pushes them into or deeper into poverty. However, the claim is not entirely accurate as it implies that all low-wage workers who are single and childless are taxed into poverty, which may not be the case for all individuals in this demographic. Additionally, the claim does not account for other factors that may affect an individual's financial situation, such as government assistance programs, education level, and job opportunities."

The claim is likely an unsubstantiated rumor or misinformation spread on social media.

The evidence suggests that Defend Florida, a group, found 13% of the 9,946 registered voters they contacted to be \"phantom voters\", which is approximately 1,300 people. However, the claim extrapolates this number to 1.4 million \"phantom votes\" based on the 11.1 million votes cast in November 2020. This extrapolation is not supported by the evidence provided and is likely an overestimation.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that those who served before 2002 get an additional $1,200 a year ($100 per month) in Social Security. However, the evidence suggests that the amount of extra credits added to the earnings record varies depending on the length of military service and which years the person was in the military. Those who served from 1957 through 1977 get $300 in additional earnings credit for each calendar quarter in which they received active-duty basic pay, and those who served from 1978 through 2001 get an additional $100 in earnings credit for every $300 in active-duty basic pay up to $1,200 per year. This means that the claim is partially true, but the amount of the additional benefit is not a fixed $1,200 per year. Additionally, the claim states that you have to ask for it and almost no one knows about it, which is also partially true, as the Social Security Administration notes that the additional earnings are credited to the earnings record, not directly to the monthly benefit amount, and that people need to ask for it to receive it. However, the evidence does not support the claim that almost no one knows about it, as the Social Security Administration provides information on the additional earnings credits and how to apply for them."

In fact, numerous investigations, including those conducted by the FBI and the Justice Department, have found that the attack on the Capitol was orchestrated and executed by individuals who supported Donald Trump's presidency and believed or pushed false claims that the 2020 election was \"stolen.\" Additionally, experts have pointed out that the scale of the riot, involving hundreds of people from all over the country, makes it unlikely that the FBI would have been involved in a plot to incite violence. The claim is also contradicted by the FBI's own statements, which have emphasized the agency's role in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the violence, rather than inciting it.

While Uttar Pradesh did report a significant decline in COVID-19 cases, it is not entirely accurate to attribute this solely to the use of ivermectin. The state's success in controlling the spread of the virus can be attributed to a combination of factors, including widespread vaccination, mask-wearing, social distancing, and other public health measures. Additionally, the claim is based on unverified and unscientific sources, and there is no conclusive evidence to support the idea that ivermectin was the primary reason for the decline in cases.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the risk of death from COVID-19 vaccines is much lower than the risk of death from COVID-19 itself. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the risk of death from COVID-19 is much higher for children under the age of 5, with 393 deaths reported as of February 2, compared to the risk of death from COVID-19 vaccines, which is extremely low.

According to the New Jersey state Division of Elections, provisional ballots are intended for voters \"whose eligibility to vote cannot be confirmed at the polls on Election Day.\" Additionally, State Statute 12.13 makes it a crime punishable by six months in jail to \"receive a ballot from or give a ballot to a person other than the election official in charge,\" but this provision does not apply to the situation described in the claim.

Additionally, some economists have stated that the bill will have a \"negligible\" impact on inflation, while others have predicted that it will have a \"modest\" or \"small\" inflationary effect. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate, as there are some economists who do project a negative impact on inflation.

The posts flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed contradict the claim, and the company's terms of service and data policy remain in effect, which do not allow the use of people's photos without their permission.

While it is true that Raz Simone was involved in the events in Seattle's police-free protest zone, known as CHOP, the claim is exaggerated and inaccurate. Simone did not \"conquer\" the area, and there is no evidence to support the claim that he handed out guns to form a paramilitary force that murdered three people. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the claim that Simone robbed locals. The claim also oversimplifies the events that occurred in CHOP and overstates Simone's role in the area. While Simone was shown on video giving out a gun, there is no evidence linking that gun to fatal shootings that occurred later. The claim is also inconsistent with the evidence, which suggests that the violence that occurred in CHOP was not orchestrated by a single individual or group, but rather was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon.

In reality, the parole provisions of the bill would not be available to people convicted of crimes in the U.S. Additionally, the bill does not provide amnesty to criminal illegal aliens, but rather a pathway to formal admission into the United States if they file an application, pay a fee, and pass criminal and security background checks.

On August 25, 2020, Governor Tony Evers called in the National Guard, and the White House authorized 2,000 National Guard troops to go to Kenosha.

While it is true that Medicare Part B premiums have increased, the evidence suggests that the increase is not directly caused by Biden's inflation crisis. The article states that Medicare Part B premiums have been growing steadily for decades to keep up with rising health spending, and several Medicare experts said the spike in the general inflation rate has little or nothing to do with the Medicare premium increase. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act caps the annual increase in the base beneficiary premium at 6%, which is a standard set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. However, the claim also implies that the increase in Medicare Part B premiums is a direct result of Biden's policies, which is not supported by the evidence. The article suggests that the increase is due to a combination of factors, including the aging of the baby boom generation and the rising cost of healthcare. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

The article states that the search was connected to an ongoing investigation into the alleged election system breach in Mesa County, and that there is no evidence to support the claim that she was singled out because of her protests.

The evidence suggests that the US has accumulated debt over time, and the current debt is a result of a combination of factors, including past spending and borrowing. Additionally, the claim implies that the spending and borrowing are reckless, but the evidence does not support this characterization. The bill is a complex piece of legislation that aims to address various issues, and the spending and borrowing are part of a broader plan to address the country's economic and social needs.

The bill requires states to submit plans to the federal government for funding, which includes how they will use the money to expand access to child care and improve the quality of child care providers. This level of federal regulation is not a government takeover, but rather a partnership between the federal government and states to improve the child care system. However, the bill does establish new restrictions on religious institutions that offer child care programs in exchange for federal support, which could be seen as a government takeover in a broader sense.

However, the claim that this would have brought in $100 billion to the state's economy is an exaggeration. According to more recent estimates, Texas would receive federal funding between $5 billion and $6 billion annually if it expanded Medicaid, which is a significant amount, but not $100 billion.

    "**VERDICT**: HALF-TRUE\n**REASON**: The claim that Joe Biden's decision to cancel the Keystone Pipeline project is to blame for U.S. gas prices is partially true, but not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that the cancellation of the pipeline project played little to no role in the current gas prices in the U.S. The main reasons for the increase in gas prices are due to a lack of oil production, global conditions, and disruptions from Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. While the pipeline project would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, it is unlikely that it would have made a significant difference in the current gas prices. Additionally, the claim that the project would have offset what the U.S. imports from Russia is also disputed, as the U.S. imports a small percentage of its oil from Russia.

The evidence provided shows that the vaccinated population in England is older on average than the unvaccinated population due to age-based prioritization in the vaccine roll-out, which increases the mortality rate for the vaccinated population compared to the unvaccinated population. Additionally, the data from the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows that the rate of hospitalization and death is \"substantially greater\" in unvaccinated people compared with vaccinated people. The claim also misrepresents the study's findings and does not take into account how vaccination patterns and other health issues vary across the age range. Furthermore, the ONS data shows that the rate of positive tests in England is higher in vaccinated people aged 30 and older, which is expected in a country with very high vaccine coverage.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the number of small businesses is up 30% compared to before the pandemic. However, the evidence provided does not support this assertion. The quote from Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, suggests that the claim should be rephrased to \"The number of new small businesses created in recent months is up 30% compared to the months immediately before the pandemic.\" This implies that the claim is referring to the number of new small businesses created, not the total number of small businesses. The evidence does not provide a direct comparison of the total number of small businesses before and after the pandemic, so the claim cannot be verified as TRUE or FALSE. Therefore, it is HALF-TRUE."

While it is true that household income has increased, the evidence suggests that the increase in income has not kept pace with the surge in prices. According to the evidence, consumer prices for everyday goods have surged over the last year, and Americans are paying more for groceries, gas, and electricity. Additionally, the evidence suggests that lower-income Americans, who tend to spend a larger fraction of their income on goods, may feel the pinch from tariffs more acutely than more affluent Americans. However, the evidence also suggests that household income is a better metric than individual income, and that many Americans operate economically as a household unit by pooling their incomes and expenses.

The system is not verified for accuracy, and reports often lack details or contain errors. Additionally, the FDA and CDC have warned that reports in VAERS do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused any health problem. The evidence also suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines have been extensively studied and have been found to be safe for pregnant women. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that pregnant people be vaccinated, and a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found no evidence of adverse maternal or fetal effects from vaccinating pregnant individuals with COVID-19 vaccine.

According to the evidence, the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccines is small and symptoms are normally mild. However, contracting COVID-19 is a strong and significant risk factor for myocarditis, especially among children under 16 years old. The evidence also suggests that the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 infection is several times greater than the risk of vaccine-related myocarditis.

The evidence suggests that the Biden administration did leave some American citizens behind in Afghanistan, but the exact number is disputed and likely lower than the claimed range.\n\nThe evidence shows that the State Department initially estimated that around 15,000 American citizens were in Afghanistan, but this number was based on assumptions and not a precise count. The actual number of Americans left behind is still unknown, but it is likely lower than the initial estimate. The Task Force Argo, a private organization, reported evacuating 2,663 people from Afghanistan, including some Americans, and the Philadelphia Enquirer reported that 61 Americans were among the 2,160 moved from Afghanistan as of October 2021. Additionally, other private groups, such as Team America, evacuated around 150 Americans as U.S. troops left Afghanistan.\n\nWhile it is true that some American citizens were left behind in Afghanistan, the claim that 10,000-15,000 were abandoned is likely an exaggeration.

Additionally, the current scientific consensus is that polar bear populations are declining due to climate change, not increasing. The claim also states that whales are nearly fully recovered, but the evidence suggests that while some whale populations have recovered, others are still threatened or endangered. The claim also states that extinctions are down 90% past century, but the evidence suggests that the number of extinctions has actually increased over the past century. The claim also states that koalas are doing fine, but the evidence suggests that koalas are actually declining and are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. The claim also states that banning wind turbines could save 85,000 birds of prey per year in the US, but the evidence suggests that there is no published research to support this claim.

According to the evidence, the credit phases out at higher income levels, and the Congressional Research Service found that the hike delivered by the Build Back Better Act would be gone for a typical married couple by the time they made about $200,000. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the credit is not entirely refundable, as it phases out at higher income levels. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is not entirely accurate."

The experts explicitly state that the omicron variant is not the same as the common cold, and that public health officials are not \"just calling the common cold\" omicron to scare people. The evidence also highlights the differences in symptoms, severity, and genetic makeup between the omicron variant and the common cold. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

The evidence suggests that there is some concern about the potential impact of mask mandates on children's learning and development, but it is not clear that this is a universal or significant effect. Some studies have found that mask mandates can have negative effects on children's learning, such as reduced verbal motor and overall cognitive performance, while others have found no clear evidence of harm. Additionally, some experts have argued that the benefits of mask mandates, such as reducing the spread of COVID-19, outweigh any potential negative effects on learning.

However, the claim that corporations are \"overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference\" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that corporate profit margins are high, the evidence suggests that this is not solely due to price gouging, but rather a combination of factors such as increased demand, supply chain disruptions, and companies' ability to pass on higher costs to consumers. Additionally, some economists argue that the rise in prices is not solely driven by corporate greed, but also by other factors such as inflation and changes in consumer behavior.

The evidence suggests that the omicron variant has the ability to infect both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and that the risk of infection is not solely dependent on vaccination status. Additionally, the claim is based on a selective presentation of data, as some studies and reports highlight the increased risk of infection among the vaccinated, while others emphasize the importance of vaccination in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.

In fact, electric vehicles can behave differently in traffic jams compared to gasoline-powered vehicles, as they do not require the engine to be running to keep the heat on. However, the claim is also exaggerated, as it implies that electric vehicles would be more likely to run out of power and become \"roadblocks\" in a traffic jam, which is not supported by the evidence.

The claim is also misleading in that it implies that the police used excessive force against unarmed Trump supporters, which is not supported by the evidence.

While the claim initially stated that \"no one has been hospitalized for it\" (referring to omicron), subsequent evidence suggests that hospitalizations have occurred. For instance, a study published on January 1 found that 15% of omicron patients were hospitalized, compared to 43% of delta variant patients and 55% of alpha patients. Additionally, the World Health Organization stated that early data from South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Denmark suggest a reduced risk of hospitalization for omicron compared to delta, but increased transmission due to omicron is expected to lead to more hospitalizations.

The evidence also states that the lieutenant governor would serve the full four-year term in the event of a governor-elect declining to take office or being unable to serve. Additionally, experts such as Peter J. Galie, an emeritus professor of political science, confirm that when the governor resigns, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, with no need for an \"interim\" designation. The only instances where the term \"interim\" is used in the evidence are in reference to situations where a governor-elect declines to take office or a governor is unable to perform their duties, which is not applicable to Hochul's situation.

While it is true that Susan Rosenberg was arrested in connection with the 1983 bombing, she was not a Black Lives Matter administrator at the time. Rosenberg was a member of the May 19th Communist Organization and was arrested in 1984 for her involvement in the bombing. She was later pardoned by President Clinton and has since worked as an administrator for Black Lives Matter. The claim is half-true because it is accurate that Rosenberg was arrested in connection with the bombing, but it is not accurate that she was a Black Lives Matter administrator at the time."

While Ginni Thomas did express support for the rally on her Facebook page and attended the event, there is no evidence to suggest that she was an organizer of the event. The New York Times debunked claims that she paid for buses to send people to the rally, and other evidence suggests that she was simply a participant and supporter of the event.

The evidence does mention that \"of the 30 measures we identified between 1917 and 1994, exactly half addressed civil rights\" but this is not the same as saying that half of all bills filibustered during this period were civil rights legislation. Additionally, the evidence also mentions that there is no official government tally for how many bills the filibuster has blocked, and that scholars have used different criteria and come up with different counts over the years.

The evidence mentions that some citizens, particularly minorities and women, may not have their names added to electoral lists or may be removed from the lists, which means they cannot vote. Additionally, the evidence highlights that voter ID laws vary across the country, and some states have stricter requirements than others.

The evidence provided shows that the ice sheet has experienced significant losses, but it is not accurate to say that it was \"destroyed\" during this time period. Additionally, the claim that the polar bear's poor condition was solely due to climate change is also an exaggeration. The evidence suggests that the bear's condition was likely due to a combination of factors, including its age and the availability of food.

In the full quote, Bourla mentioned that two doses of the vaccine offer \"very limited protection, if any\" against hospitalization and deaths, but that three doses with a booster offer \"reasonable protection\" against hospitalization and deaths, and \"very good\" protection against deaths.

According to the Brookings Institution, inflation-adjusted wages have declined slightly, but by significantly less than 7%. Additionally, the year-over-year inflation rate has fallen since its 2022 peak under Biden.

In fact, illegal immigrants are often subject to various legal restrictions and limitations, such as being unable to work legally, access certain government benefits, or participate in the political process. Additionally, the claim that they have easier access to ballot boxes is likely an exaggeration, as voting laws and regulations vary by state and locality, and illegal immigrants are generally not eligible to vote. However, it is true that some illegal immigrants may have access to healthcare services, such as emergency medical care, and that some may be able to access healthcare services through private providers or non-profit organizations.

According to the evidence, Virginia's standards for fourth-grade math and reading, as well as eighth-grade reading, are indeed the lowest among the measured states. However, the evidence also suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. For instance, the article notes that Virginia's standards are not necessarily a reflection of student performance, as students may still be learning and improving despite the low standards. Additionally, the article highlights that Virginia's standards are not the only factor affecting student performance, and that other factors such as funding and resources may also play a role.

The actual data from 2010 shows that there were 784,021 marijuana possession arrests, which translates to a pace less frequent than once every 37 seconds. However, more recent data from 2018 and 2020 shows that the pace of marijuana-related arrests has slowed down, with one arrest every 46.56 seconds in 2018 and one marijuana possession arrest about every 99 seconds in 2020.

However, the claim that natural immunity is \"superior\" to vaccinated immunity alone is not entirely accurate. The CDC also emphasizes the importance of vaccination in providing added protection to the immune system, and that vaccines can provide protection against severe disease and bad outcomes.

As stated by Rebecca Green, election law professor at William and Mary University, \"State legislatures and state/local election officials would continue to run elections in their state, but would be required to administer certain aspects of elections in a more uniform way.\" This suggests that the bill does not constitute a complete takeover, but rather a more nuanced expansion of federal oversight.

The study mentioned in the evidence, published in Cureus, did find that regular use of ivermectin was associated with significantly reduced COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates in a population of 159,561 residents in Itaja\u00ed, Brazil. However, the study was observational and not a randomized controlled trial, which is considered the gold standard of scientific research. Additionally, the FDA and other health organizations have not approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID-19, and many experts have raised concerns about the study's methodology and the lack of robust evidence supporting its findings.

Additionally, the CDC data indicates that there were 446,197 U.S. deaths attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates in 2021, and 385,443 U.S. deaths attributing COVID-19 as an underlying or contributing cause on death certificates in 2020. The claim's methodology is also flawed, as it attempts to subtract deaths that occurred in nursing homes and those with four or more comorbidities, which is not a valid or accurate way to estimate the number of COVID-19 deaths.

While it is true that the Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg, has proposed downgrading some armed robberies to misdemeanors, it is not accurate to say that all armed robberies would be downgraded to misdemeanors. According to the evidence, Bragg's memo states that not all armed robberies would be downgraded, only those determined not to \"create a genuine risk of physical harm\".

While Dr. Fauci did change his stance on some of these issues over time, the changes were largely based on new scientific evidence and evolving understanding of the pandemic. The claim is exaggerated and misleading because it presents a simplistic and inaccurate narrative of Dr. Fauci's statements, omitting important context and nuance. The evidence provided shows that Dr. Fauci's statements were often conditional and dependent on the specific circumstances, and that he consistently emphasized the importance of following scientific evidence and adapting to new information.

The evidence suggests that Hinson's opposition to the bill was due to her concerns about the bill's social spending provisions, and that the bill would have passed regardless of her vote. Additionally, the evidence shows that Hinson did support the $829 million in funding for locks and dams on the upper Mississippi River, which was allocated from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

However, the claim also implies that Biden is intentionally withholding treatment from these patients, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the decision not to provide monoclonal treatment is due to the lack of distinction between delta and omicron variants, rather than a deliberate attempt to withhold treatment. Additionally, the claim's statement about 50,000-100,000 Americans being infected by Delta every day is also not supported by the evidence, as the CDC director stated that over 75% of COVID deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities, and the evidence does not provide a specific number of daily infections.

According to the evidence, the American Rescue Plan did make quality coverage more affordable, and four out of five consumers can find a plan for $10 or less per month. However, the evidence also suggests that only about one-third of consumers who signed up for ACA coverage following the implementation of the American Rescue Plan chose a plan costing $10 per month or less.

The evidence provided shows that women and Black people have been underrepresented on the Court throughout its history, and that presidents have made implicit decisions based on race and gender in their nominations. For example, President Ronald Reagan's promise to nominate the first woman to the Court, and President Joe Biden's promise to nominate the first Black woman to the Court, demonstrate that race and gender have been considered in the nomination process.

Additionally, the evidence highlights the complexity of the issue, with some arguing that the term \"ballot harvesting\" is often used to describe a range of practices, including the collection and submission of absentee ballots by voters themselves.

The evidence suggests that the tests were not distributed earlier due to a lack of demand from testing sites and that state officials were waiting for federal approval for the tests to be used after their listed expiration.

The evidence suggests that the clots may be related to COVID-19 infection itself, and that embalmers are not necessarily aware of the vaccination status of the deceased individuals they are working with. Additionally, the claim is exaggerated by the inclusion of anecdotal reports and unverified information. The National Funeral Directors Association and experts consulted by PolitiFact have stated that embalmers in their network have noticed similar abnormalities in COVID-related deaths, but among both the vaccinated and unvaccinated. The CDC has also stated that it has not detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths following immunization that would indicate that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing or contributing to deaths.

Additionally, the evidence also mentions that dozens of people were removed from hotels in Florida, but it does not specify if they were \"illegals\" or not.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that a 95-year-old World War II veteran is being denied the right to vote by mail because he can't produce a registration number he got back in the 1950s. However, the evidence suggests that the veteran, Thompson, was eventually able to register to vote by mail after jumping through hoops, including providing ID information that matches his registration. The claim is partially true because it is true that Thompson faced difficulties in registering to vote, but it is also partially false because he was ultimately able to register. The claim also implies that the veteran's inability to produce a registration number from the 1950s is the sole reason for his denial, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the new Texas law requiring voters applying for mail ballots to provide ID information that matches their registration was the main obstacle, not the veteran's inability to produce a registration number from the 1950s."

The evidence provided shows that the Holocaust was indeed about race, as the Nazis considered Jews to be an inferior race and targeted them for persecution and genocide. The evidence includes quotes from historians and experts, as well as statements from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, which emphasizes that racism was central to Nazi ideology and that Jews were defined by race, not religion. Additionally, the evidence shows that Hitler himself described Jews as a race in his book \"Mein Kampf\". Therefore, the claim that the Holocaust was not about race is false."

Additionally, even if the Capitol had been open, it would have still been illegal for the rioters to enter areas off-limits to the public, such as the Senate Chamber. The Capitol Police and FBI have stated that the rioters violated the law by entering the Capitol building without permission.

Additionally, the claim that Pfizer is using the \"culture of fear\" to jab children is not supported by the evidence, as the company has not been found to be spreading misinformation or using fear-mongering tactics to promote its vaccine. Furthermore, the claim that Pfizer is doing so to \"make billions of dollars\" is also not supported by the evidence, as the company has not been found to be profiting from the vaccine in an unethical or illegal manner.

Additionally, the bill's purpose is to provide a record of what happens in the classroom for teachers facing harassment, rather than to spy on teachers or children.

Additionally, the evidence suggests that voter fraud in Nevada is scarce, and the state has measures in place to ensure the integrity of its elections.

According to the evidence, districts have spent only about 33% of the money provided by the American Rescue Plan, which is consistent with the claim. However, the evidence also shows that Evers has directed some of the state's COVID-19 relief funds towards various programs, such as the grant program, and has submitted draft plans to the Legislature outlining how the money could be spent.

The study found that some of these methods, including binding the mask to the face with gauze, did improve the fit and effectiveness of the mask. However, the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that these methods are widely accepted or recommended, which is not the case.

For instance, experts and immigration authorities have rejected DeSantis' claim that unaccompanied children are not vetted, and the administration has exempted children from expulsion. Additionally, the administration has provided information on its policies and procedures, and there is no evidence to support the claim that there is no transparency.

Some studies and reports suggest that masking may have a minimal impact on emotional or language development, and there is no evidence that masks endanger children by trapping carbon dioxide.

The law does not cover all types of surprise bills, and some medical bills may still be unexpected and costly. Additionally, the law does not eliminate the possibility of surprise bills entirely, but rather provides new protections against certain types of surprise billing. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Rep. Jeff Shipley said teachers should not receive a pay raise if they teach American history that Republicans don't agree with. The evidence suggests that Shipley did make a statement during a debate on the state's education budget, saying that if Critical Race Theory is important to a teacher, they just don't get a pay raise for that year. However, the evidence also shows that Shipley clarified that the tweet posted by the Democratic caucus did not accurately represent what he said on the House floor. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is based on a partial and potentially misleading representation of Shipley's statement."

However, the evidence provided shows that the CDC has tweeted about blood clots on multiple occasions before the Super Bowl, including in 2015 and 2020, and has also warned about blood clots in the context of other sporting events, such as March Madness. This suggests that the CDC's tweet about blood clots before the Super Bowl was not an isolated incident, but rather part of a broader effort to educate the public about the risks of blood clots.

According to the evidence, the U.S. economy has indeed outpaced that of other large, comparable economies, and experts agree that this rapid growth has been a factor in the United States' currently high inflation rate. However, the claim also states that inflation has been caused by the global economies shutting down all at once, reopening all at once, which is not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have also contributed to the inflation increase, and that the American Rescue Plan exacerbated inflation but was not the sole cause.

However, the claim \"100,000 Americans died of an overdose in a single year\" is not entirely accurate, as it does not specify the exact year.

Additionally, the evidence does not mention Medicare recipients getting back $2,880.

In fact, vaccinations play a role in slowing down the mutation of the virus. Additionally, the claim implies that the super virus is a direct result of over-vaccination, which is not supported by the evidence.

The evidence presented is largely based on speculation, misinformation, and misinterpretation of facts. The claims made by Trump and his allies, such as the idea that Clinton's campaign \"hacked into Trump's office\" or \"infiltrated\" his servers, are unfounded and have been repeatedly debunked by fact-checkers and experts. The Durham report, which is often cited as evidence of Clinton's alleged spying, does not support these claims and has been criticized for its lack of concrete evidence and methodological flaws.

The evidence suggests that fentanyl seizures have been increasing since at least 2016, and the trend predates Biden's presidency. Additionally, the majority of fentanyl is smuggled through ports of entry, not through illegal border crossings. The claim also implies that Biden's border policies are solely responsible for the increase in fentanyl seizures, which is not supported by the evidence.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the Keystone XL pipeline would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what the US imports from Russia. While it is true that the pipeline would have had the capacity to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day, it is not clear that it would have actually produced that amount. The evidence suggests that the pipeline would have taken years to build and faced legal challenges, and even if it had been completed, it is unlikely that it would have produced a net increase of 830,000 barrels per day. Additionally, the US imports oil from many countries, not just Russia, so offsetting imports from Russia would not necessarily have been the primary purpose of the pipeline.

However, the claim's statement about it being the most jobs created in one year in U.S. history is not entirely accurate. According to the evidence, the economy created 6.6 million new jobs in 2021, which is more than the previous one-year record of 4.2 million additional jobs in 1979, but not the most jobs created in one year in U.S. history.

Additionally, Russia has a more serious problem with human trafficking than Ukraine, according to the State Department's latest Trafficking in Persons report. Furthermore, Putin did not mention child trafficking in his speeches or public meetings in the months leading up to the invasion, and there is no evidence that his decision to wage war in Ukraine was motivated by a desire to rid the country of child trafficking.

Lee did vote for a Russia sanctions bill in January 2022, and his office stated that he stands with the people suffering from Putin's aggression in Ukraine. Additionally, Lee did not fly to the Kremlin and discuss dropping sanctions, as the Russian state-affiliated news agency Tass reported that he discussed removing sanctions during a trip to Moscow in 2019, but this was not a direct discussion with Putin.

According to the evidence, the US was actually selling its oil at a loss, and the $27 figure is likely referring to the cost of production. Additionally, the claim that the US is now paying $105 a barrel to Russia is partially true, as the US has increased its imports of Russian oil, but it's not the only factor contributing to the current high oil prices. The global pandemic and the war between Russia and Ukraine have also had a significant impact on the global oil market.

California Proposition 12, also referred to as the \"bacon ban\" by some politicians, does require housing breeding pigs, egg-laying chickens, and veal calves in facilities of a certain square footage for animal health reasons. However, the law does not ban the sale of bacon or pork products entirely. Instead, it bans the sale of pork, egg, and veal products from companies whose facilities don't meet those standards. This means that pork producers who comply with the regulations can still sell their products in California and other states. The law's goal is to prevent cruel treatment of animals in agriculture, and the ban on non-compliant products is a way to enforce the law.

Additionally, the plan would have eliminated the state's minimum markup law for gasoline, which would have resulted in a net reduction for drivers at the pump of 6 cents per gallon.

The pipeline was a proposed project that would have transported crude oil from Canada to the US, but it was not a significant source of oil for the US. The US was already importing oil from Russia, and the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline did not increase US dependence on Russian oil.

The grants were intended to help local governments conduct safe elections during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the funds were distributed through a transparent and competitive process.

The evidence also states that the Biden administration has released oil from the nation's oil stockpiles, which is intended to lower rising energy costs. Additionally, experts and officials have stated that the recent increases in U.S. gas prices are due mainly to a lack of oil production, not any actions taken by the Biden administration.

However, the evidence also notes that the number of permits has been updated and is now 6,653, which is 27% smaller than the initial claim. Additionally, the evidence highlights that companies do not have to immediately begin drilling as their leases last 10 years and can be extended beyond that.

Additionally, the evidence suggests that the state taxes are set on a cents-per-gallon rate, not a percentage of the price per gallon, which means that the percentage of money that consumers pay to the state government for gas taxes falls when gas prices rise.

The grants were part of the Equitable Grant Recovery Program, aimed at supporting organizations that work to eliminate disparities in health, child development, education, and other areas. Additionally, the grants were not the only COVID-19 relief funds allocated by Evers, as he also directed funds to other initiatives such as testing and contact tracing, infrastructure, tourism recovery, and support of small businesses.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that Jan. 6 defendants are being held in prison without being charged. However, the evidence suggests that most defendants are being held in jails pre-trial, not prison, and many have been released pending the outcome of their case. Additionally, court records show that charges have been filed against hundreds of people who were arrested and charged for their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6. While some defendants may be awaiting trial, there is no evidence to suggest that they are being held in prison without being charged. The claim is FALSE."

While the evidence suggests that Russia's weapons may be outdated, it does not specifically confirm that the weapons shown in the video are from Soviet times. The video does not provide clear evidence of the age of the weapons, and the experts quoted in the article do not confirm this claim.

While Putin's military buildup and invasion of Ukraine did contribute to a significant increase in gas prices, it is not the sole cause of the current spike. The evidence suggests that the economic recovery from the pandemic, which led to increased demand for gasoline, also played a significant role in the price increase. Additionally, the claim ignores the fact that gas prices had already been rising before Putin's military buildup, and that the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law by President Biden, likely contributed to the increase in gas prices due to its role in promoting economic recovery. Therefore, while Putin's actions did have an impact on gas prices, it is not entirely accurate to say that the current spike is \"largely\" his fault."

Instead, they stated that the match could be due to random chance or other factors. Additionally, experts have questioned the significance of the match and pointed out that it is not conclusive evidence of anything.

The evidence shows that the price of oil and gas has increased due to various factors such as the global pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and supply and demand imbalances. However, the claim that oil companies are solely responsible for the price increase is not supported by the evidence. The prices of oil and gas have fluctuated over time, and the current prices are influenced by a complex set of factors, including global events and market dynamics. The claim oversimplifies the situation and does not provide a complete understanding of the factors contributing to the price increase. Therefore, the verdict is HALF-TRUE."

According to the evidence, the median weekly pay for women in Virginia is $1,002, which is 79.5% of the median weekly pay for men, which is $1,260. This matches the claim's figure of 80 cents for every dollar. However, the evidence also notes that this figure is not an apples-to-apples comparison of men and women performing the same work, but rather a comparison of median pay for all jobs held by men and all jobs held by women. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the pay gap in Virginia is 2.8 percentage points larger than the national average. Therefore, while the claim is partially accurate, it is not entirely true."

Instead, he issued an executive order to curtail certain subsidies for fossil fuels over which the executive branch had control, but this only affected a modest slice of all fossil fuel subsidies. The bulk of such subsidies can only be overturned by congressional action, not unilaterally by Biden. Additionally, the evidence shows that Biden did not eliminate all fossil fuel subsidies, as some subsidies continued to exist, such as the foreign oil and gas exemption. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE, as it is partially accurate but not entirely accurate."

Additionally, a producer working for Channel One, a Russian-owned news channel, staged a protest against the country's invasion of Ukraine on the station's evening live newscast. This contradicts the claim that there are no live broadcasts in Russia. The claim is likely an attempt to discredit the protest and distract from the government's actions."

Additionally, the evidence provided suggests that Johnson's views on Social Security and Medicare are more nuanced and complex than the claim suggests.

While the evidence suggests that the price of insulin has increased significantly in recent years, the reasons for this increase are more complex and multifaceted than simply being \"jacked up\" by Big Drug Corporations. The evidence suggests that increased demand, lack of competition, and the complex drug pricing system all contribute to the high prices of insulin. Additionally, the evidence shows that the pharmaceutical industry disagrees with the assessment that manufacturers are reaping the benefits of the price increase, and instead argue that they are forced to raise list prices to provide bigger discounts and rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. Therefore, while Big Drug Corporations may be involved in the pricing of insulin, it is not the sole cause of the high prices."

While McCormick did lay off 50 employees at FreeMarkets, a Pittsburgh-based software company, in 2003, there is no evidence to suggest that he bragged about shipping their jobs to Asia. The evidence suggests that the layoffs were part of a restructuring effort, and the company later opened a facility in India that did not affect the employment at the Pittsburgh headquarters. Additionally, McCormick's campaign has denied that any jobs created in India or outside the US were related to the layoffs in Pittsburgh. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also contains an exaggeration or distortion."

The Federal Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that gasoline prices are higher under President Biden than they were under President Trump, and experts have noted that the price of gasoline is determined by the state of the economy and the balance of supply and demand, rather than by the president or party in power. Additionally, some evidence suggests that the claim is being used as a political talking point, with Republicans attempting to pin the blame for rising prices on Democrats and President Biden. Overall, the evidence does not support the claim that the rise in gas prices is due to the Democrats' war on fossil fuels."

According to the evidence, gas prices were increasing due to a change in demand following the easing of pandemic restrictions.

While it is true that Judge Jackson issued sentences below the guidelines and below what prosecutors were requesting in some cases, it is also important to note that she generally agreed with prosecutors' recommendations in cases that involved attempted or actual sexual abuse of a minor. Additionally, the evidence suggests that judges across the country, including conservative judges nominated under President Donald Trump, regularly disregard the federal sentencing guidelines and issue sentences that are shorter than what prosecutors request. The claim is also misleading in that it implies that Judge Jackson is \"soft on child pornography offenders\" without providing context about the complexity of the issue and the outdated nature of the federal sentencing guidelines.

While it is true that Jackson wrote an opinion in April 2020 stating that the increased risk of harm posed by the pandemic suggested that criminal defendants in D.C. custody should be released, the claim is not entirely accurate. Jackson's opinion was specific to a particular case and did not advocate for the release of all criminal defendants in D.C. custody.

The three-judge panel included two Republicans, Shirley and Nathaniel Poovey, and one Democrat, Dawn Layton. Additionally, the claim implies that Shirley's appointment was a direct result of McCrory's partisan motivations, which is not supported by the evidence. McCrory's appointment of Shirley was a routine appointment to fill a vacancy, and Shirley's decision to side with the Democrats was likely based on his interpretation of the law and the evidence presented in the case, rather than any partisan loyalty to McCrory or the Democratic Party.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true, but it is taken out of context and misleading. The evidence shows that Ketanji Brown Jackson did not say that child pornography is not as bad if it's viewed online, nor did she give pedophiles lighter sentences. The 2012 report she was summarizing discussed how the amount of child pornography a defendant accesses is not as indicative of the seriousness of the offense as it used to be, due to the widespread availability of such content online. The report suggested that the sentencing guidelines were outdated and failed to differentiate among offenders based on their culpability. Jackson's comments were taken out of context and distorted by right-wing commentators, who falsely claimed that she was defending light sentences for child pornography offenders who view the content online. In reality, Jackson has consistently issued sentences that are below the guidelines and below what prosecutors were seeking, and has shown a pattern of being tough on child pornography offenders. However, the claim that she gave pedophiles lighter sentences because it's different when they use computers vs mail is a misleading and inaccurate representation of her views."

The petition's purpose was to determine the legality of her client's detention, and the inclusion of Bush and Rumsfeld was due to their roles in the government at the time.

In fact, the evidence suggests that she has expressed support for exceptions to abortion bans for cases of rape, incest, and when the mother's life is threatened.

While it is true that there are greenhouse gas emissions associated with the construction and decommissioning of wind turbines, the evidence suggests that the energy payback time for wind turbines is less than one year, and the lifetime carbon footprint per kilowatt hour decreases as the turbine stays in service. However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that the overall return is negative, which is not supported by the evidence.

According to Katie Denis, vice president of communications for the Consumer Brands Association, \"Stores, by and large, are stocked with bread.\" Additionally, the evidence mentions that some stores may have shortages of certain products, including bread, but this is not a universal experience. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is true that some stores may not have bread, but it is not a guarantee that all stores will not have bread."

Rivian Automotive, the company mentioned in the claim, is not owned by George Soros, and the deal is expected to offer incentives to the company in exchange for a proposed factory that would bring 7,500 jobs. The details of the plan are not yet known, but it is expected to be made public once negotiations are complete. Additionally, the evidence does not provide any evidence of a \"secret backroom deal\" or any evidence that Soros owns Rivian Automotive. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

While it is true that cities in Texas and Florida saw an increase in violent crime, the evidence suggests that the increase was not necessarily more significant than in NYS. According to the evidence, the overall increase in aggravated assaults in NYS was 4%, compared to 21% in Florida and 31% in Texas. However, when looking at the increase among cities in each state, the increase in NYS came to 46%, compared to 31% in Texas and 22% in Florida. Additionally, the evidence suggests that there are cities in Florida and Texas where the percentage increase was roughly the same or even higher than the New York cities.

However, the evidence also suggests that the plan does not explicitly aim to eliminate Social Security and Medicare, and some Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have explicitly stated that they will not support a plan that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.

The evidence suggests that the plan would raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy while providing tax breaks to lower and middle classes, which would likely have a different impact on the deficit. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific information about how the tax revenue would be used to fund clean energy independence.

The bill requires healthcare practitioners to provide the same care to infants born alive after an abortion or attempted abortion as they would to any other child born alive at the same gestational age, and providers who fail to do so would face criminal prosecution.

The experts quoted in the evidence state that the price of insulin is set by the manufacturers based on market demand and production costs, and that production costs are unlikely to change significantly with increased demand. While it is true that the number of diabetes cases has increased, and therefore the demand for insulin, the experts argue that this has not had a significant impact on insulin prices.

However, the claim also states that Richard Hudson voted NO, which is not entirely accurate.

Additionally, the claim implies that Dr. Fauci's views on natural immunity have changed over time, but the evidence suggests that he has consistently expressed uncertainty about the duration of natural immunity against COVID-19. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is based on a misunderstanding of the context of Dr. Fauci's statement and exaggerates the significance of his views on natural immunity."

The commission did not have the authority to mandate textbooks, and the state law requires the governor to appoint members nominated by the state superintendent of public instruction, who was a Democrat during McCrory's tenure.

However, the evidence also suggests that the economy was not as dire as the claim suggests, as the nation had lost 2.7 million jobs during the previous administration, and the economy had already begun to recover by the time the Biden administration took office. Additionally, the evidence shows that the economy had experienced recessions in the early 2000s and 2008, which had a major impact on manufacturing, and that the auto industry was in dire shape.

The evidence also shows that vaccines are not connected to sudden death episodes, and that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the claim is based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between vaccination and infant mortality, as the data shows that areas with high vaccination rates do not have higher rates of infant mortality.

Ardern's office denied the quote, and a spokesperson stated that the quote lacks legitimacy. Additionally, the tweet that spread the quote misspells Ardern's name and has no record of her saying this in news archives or meeting transcripts.

While it is true that there has been an increase in immigration during the Biden administration, there is no evidence to suggest that the administration is intentionally allowing immigrants to enter the country solely to increase Democratic voter turnout. The evidence suggests that the increase in immigration is largely driven by natural disasters, economic or political turmoil in the immigrants' home countries, and other factors. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the majority of immigrants who enter the country illegally are becoming voters or that the administration is actively encouraging or incentivizing illegal immigration. The claim is also exaggerated, as the number of immigrants who have entered the country during the Biden administration is not necessarily a direct result of the administration's policies, and the administration has taken steps to increase immigration enforcement and deportations.

Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is accurate that Ohio public funds were invested in companies that do business in China, but it is misleading to imply that these investments were made in Chinese business interests. The second part of the claim, that Mandel opposed a bill holding Communist China accountable for cheating and stealing American jobs, is also partially true.

The evidence suggests that Evers did propose a gas tax increase, which would have increased the gas tax by 8 cents per gallon and then tied future increases to inflation (indexing). According to the fiscal bureau, this would have brought the total gas tax to 42 cents per gallon by April 1, 2022, which is 11.1 cents higher than the current rate of 30.9 cents per gallon. However, the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that the gas tax increase would have resulted in a dime increase in fuel prices, which is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

While Soros has donated to various organizations that support social justice causes, including those related to racial equality, there is no evidence to suggest that he donated $33 million specifically to Black Lives Matter. The evidence suggests that Soros' Open Society Foundations have made grants to various organizations that support racial justice and equality, but these grants are not specifically tied to Black Lives Matter. Additionally, the evidence suggests that Black Lives Matter is a decentralized global network with thousands of organizations, making it difficult to track donations to the movement as a whole. Therefore, the claim that Soros injected $33 million into Black Lives Matter is FALSE."

The evidence only mentions that Milwaukee had a higher gun recovery per capita compared to some cities, but not specifically New York.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"sugar triggers and causes cancer\" is partially true, but it is also misleading and oversimplified. While it is true that cancer cells use glucose as their primary source of energy, and that consuming large amounts of sugar can increase the risk of certain cancers, there is no conclusive evidence that sugar directly causes cancer. The evidence suggests that a diet high in sugar can contribute to weight gain and obesity, which is a known risk factor for certain cancers. Additionally, the claim that \"the best thing to do to prevent cancer is to avoid sugar\" is not supported by the evidence. A balanced diet that includes a variety of whole foods, along with regular physical activity and a healthy lifestyle, is the best way to reduce the risk of cancer. The claim is also misleading because it implies that sugar is the primary cause of cancer, which is not supported by the evidence. Overall, the claim is HALF-TRUE because it is partially accurate, but it is also misleading and oversimplified."

Adverse events can be submitted by anyone without requiring proof that they were caused by the vaccine. Additionally, the claim that Pfizer tried to hide this information is not supported by the evidence, as the information was released in a publicly available document.

According to the evidence, inflation rates have fluctuated, with some months showing a decrease or a smaller increase. Additionally, the claim implies that the current inflation rate is the highest in 40 years, which is partially true, but not entirely accurate. The evidence shows that inflation rates have been high in the past, including during the Trump presidency, and that the current rate is not necessarily the highest in 40 years.

However, the claim is not entirely false, as E15 cannot be used in certain vehicles, such as on-highway and non-road motorcycles, vehicles with heavy-duty engines, and non-road vehicles like boats and lawnmowers.

While it is true that prices have risen during Biden's presidency, the evidence suggests that the increase in prices is not solely due to Biden's spending. The evidence shows that inflation rose under Biden, but it also rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was an extraordinary historical occurrence that provoked an aggressive, and temporary, government response. Additionally, the evidence suggests that wages outpaced inflation, and the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year. The claim that prices \"skyrocketed\" is also exaggerated, as the cumulative increase in prices over Biden's presidency was 19.4%, which is a significant increase, but not a \"skyrocketing\" one. Overall, while Biden's spending may have contributed to the rise in prices, it is not the sole cause, and the claim is therefore HALF-TRUE."

The evidence includes statistics showing a 30% drop in the number of cases processed by the crime lab under Kaul compared to Schimel, and longer turnaround times in six out of 10 categories analyzed. Additionally, the evidence mentions that the crime lab is handling fewer cases and taking longer with them, which supports the claim. The only potential counterargument is that the crime lab is processing smaller caseloads under Kaul, but the evidence suggests that this is not enough to explain the significant decrease in efficiency.

However, the claim is being misrepresented by implying that she was talking about Elon Musk trying to control people's thoughts, which is not the case.

The exact price a hospital pays the Red Cross for a unit of donated blood depends on the price negotiated between the specific hospital and the Red Cross. The evidence does not support the claim that the Red Cross sells blood to hospitals for a fixed price of $150. However, the claim that hospitals charge patients thousands of dollars for a blood transfusion is TRUE, as the evidence suggests that the cost of a transfusion reflects the expenses of procuring the blood itself and the costs for labor, equipment, laboratory tests, and subspecialized medical services required to administer blood to patients.

In reality, the tax increase was part of a broader plan to raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy while providing tax breaks to lower and middle-class residents. Additionally, the claim states that Republicans \"cut your taxes by more than $2 billion,\" which is true, but it does not provide context about the timing of the tax cuts.

Disney World contributed more than $780 million in state and local taxes in fiscal year 2021, according to a company disclosure. The $200 million figure seems to be derived from state Rep.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that a consent decree approved by Gov. Brian Kemp \"invalidated all voter ID law\" and \"allowed fraudulent ballots to be accepted\" in the 2020 race. However, the evidence provided does not support this claim. The consent decree did not invalidate all voter ID laws, as evidenced by the fact that Kemp signed legislation in March 2021 that added new identification requirements to absentee voting and limited ballot drop boxes. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the consent decree allowed fraudulent ballots to be accepted. In fact, Kemp's office identified dozens of \"inconsistencies\" in the 2020 election, but those instances did not warrant an investigation by the state election board. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that Kemp did not allow fraudulent ballots to be accepted, as he rejected calls from state Republican leaders for a special legislative session to tighten voter residency requirements for the runoffs, citing the potential for endless litigation. Overall, the claim is FALSE."

The study found that the mRNA vaccines were associated with a lower risk of non-COVID-19 related deaths, and the adenovirus-vector vaccines were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. The study's lead author, Dr. Christine Stabell Benn, emphasized the need to study the overall health effects of vaccines, including their impact on non-COVID-19 related deaths.

In fact, experts who track hate crimes have stated that there isn't even a nationwide data source that Prager could have used to pin down the number of incidents that specifically involved hanging a noose or scrawling a racial slur on college buildings or grounds. Additionally, a professor of criminology and criminal justice stated that in his 40 years of experience studying hate crimes, he would say the vast majority of instances where a noose was used to threaten or intimidate, it was displayed by white individuals.

While it is true that many conservatives gained followers after the announcement, the evidence suggests that this was not solely due to Twitter lifting a shadow ban. According to Caroline Orr Bueno, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Maryland, the increase in followers was likely due to people responding to the Musk news by joining Twitter, creating new accounts, or logging into old accounts that were long dormant. Additionally, there is no evidence that Twitter changed its policies following the announcement, and various news organizations reported that Twitter had locked down its employees' abilities to make changes to the platform.

The evidence provided includes various surveys and reports that show different percentages, ranging from 42% to 76%.

The evidence shows that the tax cuts did benefit small businesses, but the majority of the benefits went to the wealthy. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the tax cuts were not as overwhelmingly beneficial to the wealthy as the claim suggests. For example, a ProPublica investigation found that the tax cuts benefited two families more than almost any others in the country, both worth billions and both among the senator's biggest donors. However, the investigation also found that the tax cuts did benefit some small businesses, such as those that function as pass-throughs.

The Brookings Institution states that 56% of outstanding student debt is owed by households that hold graduate degrees, and the Congressional Budget Office found that 40% of outstanding student debt was spent during graduate school. Additionally, Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert, notes that assuming all student loans in a household are graduate school debt if anybody in the household has a graduate degree significantly overstates the amount of graduate school debt. Therefore, while graduate school debt is a significant portion of the total student debt, the claim that almost 60% of it is graduate school debt is an exaggeration."

Additionally, the claim implies that Planned Parenthood intentionally targets minority neighborhoods, which is not supported by the evidence. While it is true that Planned Parenthood has a higher proportion of clinics in minority neighborhoods, this is likely due to a combination of factors, including the organization's mission to provide reproductive health services to underserved communities and the historical and ongoing systemic barriers to healthcare access faced by these communities. The claim's association with Margaret Sanger's eugenicist views is also misleading, as Sanger was a champion of birth control and did not support abortion.

While it is true that Democrats need more than a simple majority to pass legislation in the Senate, the claim does not accurately convey the specific circumstances under which this is the case. In the Senate, the majority party typically needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and pass legislation, not just a simple majority. However, the claim does not specify that a filibuster is necessary, and in some cases, Democrats may be able to pass legislation with a simple majority. Additionally, the claim does not account for the possibility of using the \"nuclear option\" to change Senate rules and allow for simple-majority votes on certain legislation.

While Nunn was involved in rescue efforts and has helped evacuate Americans and Afghans from Afghanistan, the evidence suggests that he did not personally lead the rescue missions and the number of Americans he saved is likely lower than 2,000. According to the evidence, Nunn worked on evacuation logistics remotely and was part of a larger effort involving multiple private groups and the US government. Additionally, the evidence suggests that some Americans in Afghanistan are still being helped by Nunn and Task Force Argo, but the exact number of Americans he has personally saved is unclear.

However, the evidence also suggests that this increase was a bipartisan effort, not solely the work of \"liberals.\" Additionally, the evidence indicates that much of the accumulated debt was not even voted on, but rather added up from spending that was on autopilot, such as automatic borrowing for Medicare and Medicaid. Therefore, while Perdue did serve during a period of significant debt growth, it is not accurate to say that he \"voted with liberals\" for $10 trillion in new debt. The claim is also exaggerated, as it implies that Perdue was solely responsible for the debt increase, which is not supported by the evidence."

However, the evidence suggests that the app is not directly sending this information to Russia. The app's permissions in the Google Play and Apple App Store do not mention accessing banking or contact information, and the app's developer, Informe Laboratories Inc., is not a Russian-based company.

Additionally, the evidence highlights the risks associated with homemade formulas, including the possibility of low calcium levels and inadequate nutrient levels.

The evidence suggests that Garland's memo was intended to address a \"disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence\" against school officials, and that he emphasized the importance of protecting parents' right to free speech. However, some critics have argued that the memo could be interpreted as targeting parents who are critical of school policies, which is a valid concern.

While some Democrats have proposed policies that would provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, there is no evidence to suggest that this is their sole or primary electoral strategy. The claim is also exaggerated, as the number of immigrants who would be granted citizenship under these proposals is not tens of millions, but rather millions. Additionally, the claim is based on a flawed assumption that immigrants will automatically vote for Democrats, which is not supported by evidence. Many immigrants who become citizens may not vote for Democrats, and some may not vote at all. The claim is also based on a flawed understanding of the immigration process, which is more complex than simply granting amnesty to illegal aliens.

The evidence suggests that there is an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation, as described by economist A. W. Phillips in 1958. When unemployment is high, wages tend to be low, and when unemployment is low, wages tend to rise, leading to inflation. However, the evidence also shows that this relationship is not always straightforward and can be influenced by various factors, such as supply chain problems, global events, and economic policies. In recent years, the relationship between unemployment and inflation has been more complex, with wages rising faster than inflation in some periods and inflation rising faster than wages in others.

Additionally, other evidence suggests that mask usage can reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect individuals from the virus.

Additionally, the county officials and election administrators emphasized that these issues were not evidence of fraud, but rather examples of the complexity of the vote-by-mail process and voters' unfamiliarity with some of the intricate details.

The UCLA report mentioned in the evidence states that school segregation is now more severe than in the late 1960s, but it also notes that modern school segregation is not the same as the government-ordered social system that the Supreme Court struck down in 1954. Additionally, the evidence highlights that while there has been an increase in segregation, it is not uniform across all schools and regions, and there are still some schools that are more integrated than others.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that \"they passed the flu off as COVID-19\" is FALSE. The evidence provided shows that the CDC changed its guidance on COVID-19 to align it with other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, due to the availability of vaccines, treatments, and high population exposure to the virus. This change was not a result of misdiagnosing flu cases as COVID-19. Additionally, the evidence does not support the claim that COVID-19 tests were picking up flu cases and labeling them as COVID-19. The CDC has consistently emphasized the importance of testing and accurate diagnosis throughout the pandemic. The claim that \"they're going to do the same thing with monkeypox and shingles\" is also FALSE, as there is no evidence to support this claim.

According to the evidence, Americans with income over $74,000 hold about 60% of the total public student loan debt, while households that earn $35,000 or less a year hold about 20% of the total public student loan debt. However, the claim that forgiveness would give the wealthy a \"financial windfall\" but not really help low-income people is also partially true, as the evidence suggests that the beneficiaries of student loan forgiveness would be higher-income, better-educated, and more likely to be white than low-income individuals. However, the claim is also overstated, as it implies that the majority of student loan debt is held by the wealthy, when in fact, a significant portion of debt is held by households with lower incomes. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that many households have undergraduate debt even though someone in the household also has a graduate degree, which could affect the distribution of debt among income groups. Overall, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also oversimplifies the complex issue of student loan debt and its distribution among different income groups."

While there is a mention of a tabletop exercise involving government and industry leaders discussing a simulated scenario of a monkeypox outbreak, this is not evidence of a real-world plan to cause the outbreak. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the outbreak is likely caused by sexual activity at two recent raves in Europe, and public health investigators are still researching how the disease spread. There is no credible evidence to support the claim that the outbreak was planned or caused by government and industry leaders. The claim is likely a conspiracy theory with no basis in fact."

The article states that the woman who was exposed to the monkeys exhibited minor symptoms such as a cough, runny nose, and pink eye, which are not typical symptoms of monkeypox. Additionally, the incubation period for monkeypox is typically no longer than 21 days, and the current monkeypox outbreak began in mid-May, which is after the January accident. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the monkeys were infected with monkeypox, and the CDC never linked the accident to the outbreak.

While it is true that there was an increase in encounters at the border in April 2022 compared to April 2020, the evidence does not conclusively link this increase to changes in border policy. The evidence suggests that various factors, including changes in border policies, contributed to the increase in encounters. For example, the evidence mentions the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decrease in immigration, and the subsequent reopening of the border, which may have contributed to the increase in encounters.

The evidence does mention that 50% of private transfers of firearms within the previous two years were obtained without a background check, but this is not the same as saying that 50% of all guns sold in Texas do not pass through a background checks. Additionally, the evidence highlights that there is no comprehensive data on the percentage of gun transactions or guns currently possessed in which there was no National Instant Criminal Background Check System check, making it difficult to determine the exact percentage of guns sold in Texas that do not pass through a background check.

The evidence suggests that there are many variables at play, and it is difficult to determine causation. Additionally, the claim ignores the fact that gun laws in nearby states, such as Indiana and Wisconsin, are less stringent, which could affect the gun violence rates in these cities. Furthermore, the claim does not account for other factors that could contribute to gun violence, such as socioeconomic conditions, poverty, and access to mental health services.

However, the evidence does not provide a direct link between this 15% and the total number of abortions. The claim may be exaggerated or misinterpreted, as it is unclear how this 15% translates to the total number of abortions.

In the 2020 Georgia primary election, Brian Kemp received 74% of the votes, as mentioned in the evidence.

However, the evidence also suggests that this figure may not be entirely accurate, as Philip Cook, a co-author of the research, stated that he was confident that there were not 1.5 million lives saved in 1994 through defensive gun uses.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Waiting periods for gun purchases may not make a difference, because 'If somebody's decided that they're gonna take their life, they're gonna take their life'\" is partially true. While it is true that some people who are determined to take their own life may still do so despite a waiting period, the evidence suggests that waiting periods can still have a positive impact on reducing gun violence and suicide deaths. The evidence provided shows that waiting periods can reduce gun homicides by 17% and states with waiting periods avoid around 750 homicides per year. Additionally, experts argue that waiting periods can prevent impulsive decisions and give people time to cool off, which can reduce the likelihood of violent behavior. However, the claim is also partially false because it oversimplifies the issue and ignores the potential benefits of waiting periods in preventing gun violence and suicide deaths."

While Ukraine's language law does favor Ukrainian and has been criticized for not providing sufficient protections for minority languages, it does not prohibit the use of the Russian language. The law requires public sector workers to know Ukrainian and obliges certain professionals to communicate in Ukrainian, but it does not ban the use of Russian in everyday life, education, or media. Additionally, the law allows for exceptions for minority languages like English and other European Union languages, but Russian is not included in this category.

The evidence shows that Beasley and the state Supreme Court vacated the conviction of a man who was convicted of seeking sex with a boy online, but the conviction was vacated after the man had already completed his time in prison and the conviction remains in state records. Additionally, the evidence shows that Beasley and the state Supreme Court also vacated the conviction of a man who was convicted of sexually assaulting a 7-year-old girl, but the conviction was vacated due to procedural errors and not because Beasley or the court was sympathetic to the offender. The claim that Beasley \"set free\" a child porn offender is also misleading, as the evidence shows that the offender was not released from prison and was instead granted a new trial due to procedural errors. Overall, while Beasley and the state Supreme Court did vacate some convictions, the claim that she \"tossed the conviction\" and \"set free\" a child porn offender is exaggerated and omits important details."

However, the evidence suggests that the bill in question, H.R. 7910, does not specifically criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and re-assembling a gun without a manufacturer's license. Instead, it aims to prohibit the manufacturing of \"ghost guns\" by defining \"manufacturing\" as including the assembly of a functional firearm from kits or individual parts that lack serial numbers. The bill does not address the specific actions of disassembling, cleaning, and re-assembling a gun.

Additionally, the House committee's investigation found that Vice President Mike Pence, not Trump, called for the National Guard on January 6, 2021. Furthermore, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, stated that no request was made for the National Guard before January 6, 2021, and the Speaker of the House does not have the power to authorize the deployment of the National Guard.

Some sources suggest that there may have been individuals in the crowd who were carrying weapons, although it is unclear what type of weapons they were or whether they were actually used. Additionally, some sources mention that there were reports of people shouting \"gun!\" and attendees starting to run, which could suggest that there was a perceived threat of a firearm being present.

In fact, they emphasize that the notion of communist control is \"nonsense\" and that the claim is \"absolutely ludicrous.\" The evidence also highlights the distinction between communist influence and actual control, noting that the Soviet Union and China have used various tactics, including infiltration and propaganda, to exert influence, but have not achieved control. Additionally, the evidence provides specific examples of communist influence in China, such as the Communist Party's control over state-owned enterprises and its efforts to tighten its influence on private companies, but these are not equivalent to control over U.S. institutions.

The legislation in question lowered the minimum age for amusement park ride operators from 18 to 16, subject to carnival ride and safety training, which was a response to the amusement park industry's struggle to find workers post-COVID. The child's death occurred in 2021, and the legislation was passed in 2022.

The man was not an armed kidnapper, but rather a defendant who was convicted of armed robbery and kidnapping. Additionally, the claim implies that Beasley's decision to vacate the conviction resulted in the man's early release, which is not accurate. The man had already completed his sentence and was not released early as a result of Beasley's decision.

However, a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, including all but one member of the G-7 group. The evidence also suggests that the US economy is recovering at a faster pace than many other countries, which has contributed to its higher inflation rate.

While border agents do have some unique powers within the 100-mile zone, they are not allowed to enter people's homes without a warrant.

The evidence suggests that some forms of gender-affirming care, such as social support and allowing children to express their gender identity through clothing and pronouns, are not experimental and are widely accepted as part of gender-affirming care. Additionally, there are studies that have demonstrated the positive effects of gender-affirming care on transgender youth, including reduced depression and suicidality.

The evidence shows that some bodies of water experienced an initial decrease in pollution when DeSantis entered office, but then an uptick toward the end of his first term. Additionally, the number of polluted estuaries decreased from 2.5 million acres in 2018 to 2.1 million in 2020, but then increased to 3.1 million in 2022.

Additionally, the evidence suggests that the claim is based on a flawed study that was presented at a meeting of the International Olympic Committee, but was not conducted by the IOC. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that there is no credible evidence that vaccines are driving a sudden rise in cardiac arrests among athletes.

The article also mentions that the NFL reported that 95% of its players were vaccinated as of February 2022, but Hamlin's vaccination status is unknown, which further undermines the claim. Additionally, the article debunks similar claims that professional athletes were collapsing due to heart issues brought on by the COVID-19 vaccines, and there is no credible evidence to support this claim.

The evidence provided supports this claim, showing that the number of Venezuelans encountered at the southern border decreased from around 1,100 per day to around 230 per day in November. This reduction is attributed to the parole program, which allows eligible Venezuelans to enter the U.S. legally and work for two years. The evidence also mentions that U.S. Customs and Border Protection data backs up President Biden's claim that illegal immigration from Venezuela drastically decreased after the parole program's implementation. Therefore, the claim is TRUE."

The evidence suggests that drag shows do not inherently involve nudity or the removal of clothes, as drag queens often wear more clothing than a typical American woman of the 21st century. However, the claim also implies that drag shows are equivalent to strip shows, which is not accurate. Drag shows are a form of entertainment that involves dressing and acting exaggeratedly as another gender, often for entertainment purposes, whereas strip shows typically involve the removal of clothes for the purpose of sexual gratification. While some drag shows may involve suggestive or provocative performances, they are not the same as strip shows.

While it is true that cellphone data was used to track down the suspect, the claim is not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that cellphone data was used in conjunction with other evidence, such as DNA and video surveillance, to make the arrest. The claim implies that cellphone data was the sole or primary evidence used to make the arrest, which is not supported by the evidence. Additionally, the claim does not address the criticisms of the \"2000 Mules\" movie's use of cell data, which were based on the movie's methodology and conclusions, not the use of cellphone data in general.

While it is true that overdose deaths did decline in 2018, the evidence suggests that this decline was a one-time anomaly and that overdose deaths continued to rise during Trump's remaining three years in office. Additionally, the evidence shows that the number of overdose deaths related to synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, increased during Trump's presidency, contrary to the claim that he \"marshaled the full power of government to stop deadly drugs, opioids, and fentanyl from coming into our country.\" Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also misleading and incomplete."

While it is true that a default on the debt would be unprecedented in the sense that it would be the first time the US government has failed to pay its debts, it is not entirely accurate to say that a default has never happened before. The evidence suggests that the US has defaulted on its debts in the past, albeit in different forms. For example, the US defaulted on its gold-backed currency in 1971, and there have been instances of the government failing to meet its debt obligations in the past. However, the claim is still partially true in the sense that a default on the debt would be unprecedented in the modern era and would have significant consequences for the US economy and global financial markets."

The evidence suggests that the organization has researched temporary birth control vaccines, but not permanent sterility vaccines.

However, the claim is also partially false because it implies that Biden did not have the right to declassify documents at all, which is not accurate.

While the White House has not proposed a blanket ban on gas stoves, there are efforts to regulate and phase out gas appliances in new homes. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has proposed efficiency standards for gas and electric cooking appliances, which would mean that about half of current gas stove models would not comply with the rule in 2027. However, this is not a ban on existing gas stoves, and the White House has explicitly stated that it does not support banning gas stoves.

The course covers care for infants with physical variations in sex development that arise in utero and are present at birth, which may include infants with gender identities or sexual orientations that are not necessarily LGBTQIA+.

Some studies suggest that increased access to contraception can lead to a decrease in unintended pregnancies and subsequently, abortions (e.g., \"by Guttmacher concluded that a steep drop in abortions from 2008 to 2011 was driven by a decline in unintended pregnancies largely spurred by more and better contraceptive use.\"). However, other evidence suggests that increased access to contraception may not necessarily lead to a decrease in abortion demand, as unintended pregnancies may still occur despite increased access to contraception (e.g., \"A number of studies have demonstrated that as contraception becomes more accessible, the number of unwanted pregnancies actually rises, thus increasing the demand for abortion.\").\n\nOverall, the evidence is mixed, and it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion about the relationship between contraception availability and abortion demand.

According to the evidence, the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at its lowest level in about 40 years, and Biden did release 180 million barrels of oil from the reserve. However, the evidence also shows that Biden has taken other actions to address the energy crisis, such as releasing oil from the reserve in November 2021 and considering using disaster powers to suspend oil and gas drilling.

The evidence also mentions that the cost of chicken has also gone up, but not as drastically, and that the price of a dozen large eggs costs more than $7 in some U.S. regions. However, it also notes that the average price for a dozen eggs in the U.S. was $4.25 in December 2022, up from $1.79 a year earlier, which is a 130% increase, but still not 700%.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that the Transportation Security Administration spent \"a couple hundred million dollars\" on gender-neutral screening technology is partially true. According to the evidence, the TSA received $18.6 million to improve its Advanced Imaging Technology units, which makes the process gender-neutral. However, the claim is exaggerated, as it implies that the entire amount was spent on gender-neutral screening technology, which is not accurate. The evidence does not provide a clear breakdown of how the funds were allocated, but it suggests that the funds were used to improve the screening machines, which is a broader goal that includes making the process gender-neutral.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the grid today cannot handle the increased electric load if New York's proposed limits on natural gas in buildings take effect. While National Grid, one of the companies that deliver electricity to customers in New York, has expressed concerns about the grid's ability to handle increased demand, experts have also noted that the grid has more capacity in some areas and less in others, and that the ability to handle the added demand depends on where conversions from natural gas to electricity occur. Additionally, some experts have suggested that the grid will require additional capacity to support the shift away from fossil fuel energy sources, but that it will ultimately be cost-effective. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is not entirely accurate, as the grid's ability to handle increased demand is dependent on various factors and is not a simple yes or no answer."

While it is true that some classified documents, particularly those marked top secret/sensitive compartmented information, require special handling and are typically stored and viewed in SCIFs, it is not true that all classified documents can never be taken out of a SCIF. The evidence suggests that documents with lower classifications can be removed from a SCIF as long as proper protocols are followed, and even top secret/sensitive compartmented information can be removed from a SCIF if proper protocols are followed. Additionally, some classified documents may not even require storage in a SCIF, as they may be stored in less restrictive classified spaces.

The FHSAA's preparticipation physical evaluation form asks female athletes about their menstrual history, including when they got their first period, how many weeks typically pass between periods, and when they had their last period. However, this information is marked as optional, and schools are not required to collect it.

According to the evidence, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits peaked at 23.1 million in early May 2020, and then decreased to around 4.8 million by January 2021. This means that the claim is correct that the number of people receiving unemployment benefits has decreased significantly over the past two years. However, the claim is incorrect in stating that the number was 18 million two years ago. The evidence suggests that the number was actually much higher, around 4.8 million.

For example, some states require same-day registrants to sign an oath attesting that they're providing accurate information, and voters who provide false information or commit fraud are subject to criminal charges.

While the evidence suggests that fuel costs for electric vehicles can be higher than for internal combustion engine vehicles, especially for luxury cars, it also shows that the cost difference is not always significant. For example, the report found that drivers of midpriced electric cars paid about $11.60 to charge their vehicles at home for 100 miles of driving, while drivers of similarly priced internal combustion engine cars paid about $11.29 in fuel costs for 100 miles of driving. Additionally, the evidence suggests that electric vehicles have lower maintenance costs and can be more environmentally friendly, which may offset the higher upfront costs.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that children who go to preschool are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- or four-year degree, no matter their background they came from. While the evidence suggests that preschool attendance is associated with increased college attendance and degree completion, the exact 50% figure is not supported by the evidence. The studies cited in the evidence show varying degrees of impact, with one study finding an 18% increase in college attendance and another finding a 48% higher rate of degree completion. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the impact of preschool attendance on college attendance and degree completion may vary depending on factors such as the type and length of preschool enrollment, as well as the racial and socioeconomic background of the students. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially supported by the evidence but also contains an exaggeration."

The evidence shows that the 87,000 new IRS agents were hired to focus on enforcement against wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, not specifically on waitresses' tips. The IRS has always required workers to report their tip income as part of their federal income taxes. The new proposal is a voluntary program for service industry employers to report tips to the IRS, which is not a new requirement for workers. The claim is exaggerated and misleading, as it implies that the IRS is targeting waitresses' tips specifically, which is not the case. The evidence also shows that the IRS has clarified that the new proposal is not a plan to audit servers, and that tip income has always been taxable. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

While it is true that the southern border is not \"open\" and that fentanyl is being smuggled into the country, the claim that Biden's border policies are the sole cause of the fentanyl crisis is an exaggeration and not supported by the evidence.\n\nThe evidence suggests that fentanyl has been a problem in the U.S. for many years, and that the increase in fentanyl-related deaths is a complex issue that cannot be attributed to a single factor, including Biden's border policies. The evidence also suggests that the majority of fentanyl is being smuggled into the country through ports of entry, not through illegal border crossings.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence shows that the U.S. government has been working to address the fentanyl crisis, including increasing funding for drug detection technologies and strengthening penalties for trafficking. While there is still more work to be done, it is unfair to blame Biden's border policies for the entirety of the fentanyl crisis. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

Additionally, the claim that billionaires pay a lower tax rate than schoolteachers or firefighters is also partially true, but it is not accurate to say that they pay a lower tax rate than these individuals. According to the evidence, the top 25 billionaires paid a tax rate of 16%, which is higher than the estimated tax rate for schoolteachers and firefighters.

The evidence suggests that the DO Black card is a prepaid debit card that measures a person's carbon footprint through their purchase activity and restricts the ability to use the card once they reach their carbon limit for the year. It is not a credit card and does not allow the government to track people's movements or limit their freedom. The card is part of a program to encourage sustainable consumption choices and is not a tool for government control. Additionally, the card is not a government-issued card, but rather a partnership between Mastercard and a Swedish fintech company. The claim is likely a result of misinformation and conspiracy theories spread through social media."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: While it is true that chlorine is a poison, the claim that drinking or using tap water treated with chlorine is dangerous is partially false. Chlorine is added to tap water to disinfect it and make it safe to drink, and the amount of chlorine allowed in tap water is regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. However, prolonged exposure to chlorine above the legal limit can cause eye and nose irritation and stomach discomfort. Additionally, some people may be more sensitive to chlorine and may experience adverse effects. Therefore, while chlorine is a poison, the claim that it is dangerous in the context of tap water is only partially true."

According to the evidence, Black child poverty dropped from 17.2% in 2020 to 8.3% in 2021, which is a 52% decline, but not exactly half. Additionally, the evidence also mentions that the child tax credit expired, and child poverty spiked, which suggests that the credit's impact was not solely responsible for the reduction in poverty.

However, the claim that wind turbines use 80 gallons of synthetic oil to operate is partially true, as wind turbines do use oil to lubricate their moving parts, but the amount needed varies greatly depending on the turbine's design. The claim that 12,000 gallons of crude oil are needed to make 80 gallons of synthetic oil is FALSE, as there is no credible source to support this claim.

The evidence states that the removal was due to federal requirements and inactivity through two federal election cycles (2020 and 2022).

However, this does not mean that the drinks contain the virus or that the tests are unreliable. The tests are designed to detect the presence of the virus, and a positive result does not necessarily mean that the individual is infected.

Additionally, there is no recent evidence of the US issuing a warning to Uganda to legalize homosexuality or face the loss of aid. The US has expressed concerns about the new anti-homosexuality bill introduced in Uganda and has called on the government to veto it, but there is no indication of a \"final warning\" being given.

The quote provided by Greene is likely a misquote or a fabrication.

The parents also requested a conversation with school staff about the name and pronoun changes two days before the student was going to return to school.

However, the claim also implies that if the Brewers leave Wisconsin, all player salaries that generate dollars for the state would go away. This is not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that the state-level taxpayer funds for the stadium would come from the income tax generated from Brewers employees, including players, and visiting players who also pay income taxes when they are in Milwaukee.

The evidence does not support the claim that Kelly \"pocketed\" the contributions or that he unrecused himself solely to judge the case.

According to the evidence, 19 police officers died while responding to domestic violence calls, which is a significant number. However, the evidence also shows that 68 officers died while responding to disorder/disturbance calls, which includes domestic violence, but also other types of disturbances. Therefore, while domestic violence calls are a significant contributor to police officer fatalities, they are not the most common circumstance in which officers are killed.

The evidence suggests that the Tennessee lawmakers' actions were peaceful and authorized, whereas the Jan. 6 insurrection was violent and unlawful. The comparison made by Cameron Sexton, the Republican speaker of the Tennessee House, is inaccurate and misleading. The evidence also highlights the significant differences between the two events, including the fact that the Jan. 6 insurrection involved violence, vandalism, and an attempt to overthrow the government, whereas the Tennessee lawmakers' actions were peaceful and aimed at promoting legislative action against gun violence.

The evidence suggests that the report in question estimated 310,000 excess deaths due to COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 and 2022 combined, not specifically in 2022. Additionally, the evidence highlights that the report's methodology is flawed, and experts have disputed the claim that COVID-19 vaccines caused the excess deaths.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the 5 states with the highest gun homicide rates have loose gun laws, and the 5 states with the lowest rates have some of the toughest laws. The evidence suggests that this is partially true. The 5 states with the highest gun homicide rates (Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Missouri, and South Carolina) do have relatively permissive gun laws, such as allowing guns to be carried without a permit and having barriers to enforce federal gun laws. However, the evidence also shows that some states with relatively permissive gun laws (such as Nebraska and North Dakota) have low rates of gun homicides, and some states with stricter gun laws (such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Minnesota) are in the bottom 10 for gun homicide rates. Additionally, the evidence suggests that factors beyond gun laws, such as poverty rates and trauma care resources, can also influence a state's gun homicide rate. Therefore, while there is some correlation between gun laws and gun homicide rates, the claim is not entirely accurate."

Additionally, the evidence shows that the claim is exaggerated and misleading, as it is not accurate to say that Canada has made it illegal to protest against the LGBT.

In fact, other studies have reported significant warming in certain regions of Antarctica, such as the western region and the peninsula, over the past 30 years. Additionally, the claim implies that the lack of warming in Antarctica is evidence against human-driven climate change, which is not supported by the scientific consensus.

Additionally, some schools may choose to teach the document in a minimal or cursory manner, but this does not necessarily mean that it is not taught at all.

The evidence also highlights that there have been significant disparities in homeownership rates between Black and white Americans, with white Americans having a 72.7% homeownership rate in 2022, compared to 44% for Black Americans. Additionally, the evidence mentions that Black homeowners derive fewer benefits from mortgage interest deductions and that Black-owned homes tend to be in communities where houses don't appreciate as much, which may contribute to the persistent homeownership gap. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is not entirely accurate and oversimplifies the complex issue of homeownership rates for African American families."

Additionally, experts and studies have shown that the medication is safe and effective, and that pregnancy itself is associated with more deaths than the medication.

While Florida does have a relatively low tax burden, the evidence suggests that it is not the second-lowest. According to the evidence, Florida ranked 11th lowest in tax burden when looking only at state taxes and 49th place when including state and local taxes. Additionally, the state's tax system is considered regressive, meaning that lower-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. Therefore, while Florida does have a low tax burden, it is not the second-lowest in the country."

While it is true that the number of people living in state and county psychiatric institutions decreased significantly from 1955 to the 2010s, this was a result of a combination of factors, including the development of antipsychotic medications, changes in public policy, and a shift towards deinstitutionalization.

In fact, the evidence suggests that buyers with credit scores above 780 may see fees reduced or remain the same, while buyers with lower credit scores may see fees decrease.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Texas Republicans gave a Republican appointee the power to single-handedly cancel election results in the state's largest Democratic county. However, the evidence suggests that the bill in question (HB 2507) does not grant a single individual the power to cancel election results. Instead, it creates criteria for the secretary of state to order a new election in Harris County if certain conditions are met, such as if at least 2% of polling places ran out of usable ballots during voting hours and did not receive supplemental ballots for one or more hours after requesting such ballots. This decision would still require the approval of the secretary of state, not a single Republican appointee.

However, the evidence suggests that the change is not a pay raise, but rather a change in how lawmakers' expenses are reimbursed. The evidence also shows that the change was approved with bipartisan support and does not circumvent the Constitution. While the claim is partially accurate in that the change does reimburse lawmakers for expenses, it is misleading in its characterization of the change as a pay raise and its claim that it circumvents the Constitution.

Additionally, some of the evidence suggests that some North Carolina Republicans have taken positions that are opposed to reproductive rights, such as supporting stricter abortion restrictions or calling for the elimination of abortion in all cases.

This is a subtle but important distinction, as Gore's statement was not a prediction of complete ice loss, but rather a prediction of a significant decline in ice extent during the summer months.

However, the evidence also shows that the transferred funds were replaced with federal COVID-19 relief money, which means that the overall mental health funding was not reduced. Additionally, the evidence suggests that Texas has consistently ranked near the bottom in mental health spending, and the state has not expanded Medicaid, which could provide additional funding for mental health services.

The recommended reparations are estimated to be around $13,619 per year of residency, which would be around $1 million for a 71-year-old resident. However, this is not a guarantee that every Black resident would receive this amount, and the claim is exaggerated.

However, the evidence also highlights that not all districts offer pre-K programs, and some districts have limited seats, which means that not all eligible children have access to public preschool. Additionally, the claim is not entirely accurate as it implies that 96% of eligible children will attend public preschool, when in reality, the funding is available for districts to serve preschoolers, but not every district has done so.

The video shows empty shelves at a packaged deli section of a Walmart store, but it also shows a wall full of products and a cart with cardboard boxes. Additionally, experts have explained that the empty shelves could be due to various reasons such as cleaning and restocking, mechanical problems with refrigeration, or a genuine supply chain issue.

However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that Al Franken wrote the provision, which is not accurate.

In fact, many studies have found no significant impact or even declines in employment rates due to work requirements.

The evidence suggests that Wisconsin has a history of electing both Democratic and Republican leaders, and its voting patterns are not as straightforward as being solely blue. The claim is half-true because it is accurate that Wisconsin has voted for Democratic presidential candidates, but it oversimplifies the state's political landscape by implying it is predominantly blue."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence suggests that the claim is false because there is no credible evidence that a movement representing \"minor attracted people\" has adopted a flag that is being integrated into LGBTQ+ advocacy. In fact, the evidence suggests that the flag is likely an online prank and that LGBTQ+ advocates do not endorse it. Additionally, reputable organizations such as GLAAD and Equality NC have explicitly stated that they do not support pedophilia and do not recognize the flag as a legitimate symbol of the LGBTQ+ community. The evidence also suggests that the flag is not widely recognized or used by the LGBTQ+ community, and that it is not an official symbol of the community. Therefore, the claim is false."

Additionally, multiple reputable sources, including the European Medicines Agency, the World Health Organization, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have stated that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for pregnant women and do not increase the risk of infertility, miscarriage, or other complications.

The evidence retrieved shows that Alexandra Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's daughter, filmed footage of her mother on January 6, 2021, which was later released by the Jan. 6 select committee and an HBO documentary. The footage shows Pelosi discussing the National Guard's delayed deployment and taking responsibility for not having the National Guard at the Capitol that day.

Additionally, the claim implies a causal link between the presence of biological boys in locker rooms and the suicidal thoughts of teenage girls, which is not supported by the evidence.

According to the evidence, the city of Milwaukee announced the five in-person voting centers for the April 7, 2020, election on April 3, 2020, which is five days before the election. Additionally, the city's Election Commission executive director acknowledged that the lack of notice under existing standards was due to the pandemic and other factors.

For example, his executive order on birthright citizenship, which stated that children born to non-immigrant visa holders are not automatically US citizens, was a significant change to the existing policy. Additionally, his administration's immigration enforcement policies, such as the \"zero tolerance\" policy, led to the separation of thousands of families at the border.

According to the evidence, the US Flag Code does specify that the American flag should be in a place of prominence and centered in a display. However, the evidence also suggests that the White House did not breach the code in the way claimed. The flag code does not specify that the American flag must be the only flag displayed, and the White House displayed multiple flags, including the American flag, during the event. Additionally, the White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, stated that the event was centered around love and family, which is consistent with the purpose of the pride flag.

This suggests that the median income is likely higher than $35,000 a year.\n\nThe claim \"Because of Joe Biden's inflation, the average monthly expenses have increased by $500, almost\" is partially true. The evidence does mention that inflation peaked at a four-decade high of about 9.1% in summer 2022, and that the average monthly expenses have increased by $500, almost. However, the evidence also suggests that wages have risen by 10% over the past two years, which may have offset some of the increase in expenses.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that China sends \"fentanyl into America killing 80,000 Americans a year\" is partially true. While it is true that fentanyl is a significant contributor to the opioid epidemic in the United States, and that China is a major source of fentanyl, the claim that China directly sends fentanyl into the US and is responsible for 80,000 deaths per year is an exaggeration.\n\nAccording to the evidence, China was the primary source of illicit fentanyl early in the US opioid epidemic, but when the Chinese government banned the production of fentanyl in 2019, producers switched to selling chemicals used in the production of fentanyl. Additionally, Chinese drug producers primarily create the chemicals to make fentanyl and send it to Mexican cartels, not directly to the US. The claim that China sends fentanyl into the US and is responsible for 80,000 deaths per year is a misleading interpretation of the trafficking of fentanyl into the US.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the claim that fentanyl is killing 80,000 Americans per year is not entirely accurate. While fentanyl is a significant contributor to opioid-related deaths, the evidence suggests that the number of fentanyl-related deaths is lower than 80,000 per year. For example, according to the evidence, fentanyl deaths are on the rise in the US, but the number of deaths is not as high as 80,000 per year.

According to the evidence, the longest stretch of unemployment below 4% was during the period from December 1965 to January 1970, which was 50 months.

Additionally, the evidence shows that the decline in college enrollment is not unique to West Virginia, as the national college enrollment rate has also fallen, albeit not as rapidly.

According to the evidence, there have been around 8 million encounters at the border since Biden took office, but it is not clear how many of these encounters were illegal.

The U.S. government does not provide free solar panels, and the claim is likely an empty promise.

The evidence suggests that thermography is not a proven alternative to mammography and that the FDA has not approved it as a standalone screening test. While thermography may have some benefits, such as being a non-invasive and painless test, the evidence does not support the claim that it is safer or more effective than mammography. In fact, experts and cancer-preventing organizations recommend mammograms as the standard screening method for breast cancer, and the FDA has approved thermography devices only as tools for use alongside a primary screening test such as mammography. Additionally, the claim that mammograms are outdated and dangerous is also FALSE, as mammograms have been a recommended breast cancer screening method for decades and have been shown to be effective in detecting breast cancer at an early stage.

This is supported by multiple sources, including the Insurance Information Institute and Insurify, a national insurance agency.

However, there is no evidence to support the claim that all of these individuals were given a free cellphone and airline tickets. Some evidence suggests that migrants are given a cellphone and a plane ticket to facilitate their travel, but this is not a universal practice. Additionally, the claim that 7 million people crossed the border illegally is likely an exaggeration, as the actual number of encounters at the border is around 8 million, but not all of these individuals may have crossed illegally.

While Planned Parenthood employees did provide information to undercover actors posing as sex traffickers, the employees also followed protocol and reported the incidents to their supervisors and law enforcement. Additionally, Planned Parenthood took disciplinary action against the employees involved and cooperated with authorities.

However, the claim's assertion that \"tens of millions\" is not entirely accurate, as the evidence only suggests that around 100 million people live in areas with a shortage of primary care providers, not necessarily that all of them cannot find a doctor. Additionally, the claim's statement about people having to wait months to be seen is also not entirely accurate, as the evidence suggests that while wait times can be a problem, it's not necessarily months-long.

For example, the Arizona law that banned ethnic studies in public schools was not specifically targeting Latino or Hispanic studies, and the Texas textbook ban was due to concerns about racism and inaccuracy, not a desire to prevent the teaching of Latino history. Additionally, some states have actually taken steps to promote the teaching of Latino and Hispanic history, such as California's requirement for public high school students to take ethnic studies.

Additionally, the evidence shows that drug shortages have been a long-standing issue in the US, dating back to the Obama administration, and are caused by a variety of factors, including natural disasters, manufacturing problems, and slim profit margins on generic drugs.

However, the evidence suggests that this is not accurate. The Netherlands' euthanasia law does not allow people to be euthanized against their will, and doctors are not \"ordered\" to perform euthanasia on patients who do not request it. Additionally, the law requires that patients must request euthanasia themselves, and that doctors must be satisfied that the request is voluntary and well-considered. While it is true that some people with autism or intellectual disabilities have used the euthanasia law, this is not because they were \"ordered\" to do so, but rather because they made the decision themselves.

While Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law prohibiting the teaching of critical race theory in Florida's workplaces and schools, it is unclear whether the theory was actually being taught in K-12 schools before the law was passed. The evidence suggests that critical race theory was not being taught in Florida's elementary, middle, or high schools, as stated by educators, school officials, and several Florida public school districts. However, the law's language is broad and could potentially impact other educational materials or discussions that touch on systemic racism and privilege, which are core components of critical race theory.

The evidence also shows that some people are trying to restrict the ability to question the results of an election by making it illegal to challenge the qualifications of voters or to investigate alleged fraud. However, it is not clear that this is being done solely to prevent questioning of the results of a bad election.

The experts cited in the evidence explain that structures like trees and utility poles are less likely to be consumed by wildfire flames because heat can escape to the atmosphere, they are exposed to flames for less time than things in an enclosed space, and oxygen, which is needed for combustion, can reach only the outside of a solid wood object. Additionally, the evidence shows that it is common for trees, utility poles, and more isolated features to remain standing even as wildfires destroy other structures in the same area. This is consistent with the claim that wildfires do not completely burn out cars, glass and all, yet leaving nearby trees and utility poles still standing upright."

In fact, officials have stated that the cause of the fires has not been determined and that there is no evidence to support the claim that they were set intentionally. Additionally, the quotes provided from residents and officials do not support the claim, with one resident stating that the governor's plan is to rebuild and restore the area, not to create a \"smart island.\" Overall, the evidence suggests that the claim is FALSE."

While the US has made significant progress towards energy independence, it is not entirely accurate to say that it was achieved in just three years. The evidence suggests that the US has been working towards energy independence for over a decade, and it is a complex and multifaceted concept that cannot be reduced to a single timeline or metric.

However, the evidence suggests that the bill has not been blocked by Cooper, as it has not made it to his desk for signature or veto. The Republican-led legislature has not advanced the bill to his desk, and even if it did, Cooper would not be able to block it due to the veto-proof supermajorities held by Republican lawmakers. The claim is partially true in the sense that Cooper has opposed vouchers in the past and has expressed concerns about the bill, but the ad's assertion that he is blocking the bill is inaccurate."

The evidence also shows that the percentage increase in jobs in 2021 was not the highest in history, and that wages have not necessarily increased at the same rate as the number of jobs.

Norway, for example, does not offer gender-affirming surgical care to minors, but it is not banned. Sweden has a 1970s law that restricts genital surgery, but it is not a ban on gender-affirming care.

However, it does not provide a specific example of a drug that costs $500 a month being reduced to 35 cents.

According to the evidence, wages have increased substantially, but less than inflation, resulting in a slight decline in real wages. Additionally, the Great Depression was a period of unprecedented economic downturn, with a decline in gross domestic product of over 30% between 1929 and 1933, which is not comparable to the current economic situation.

The WHO's website states that the treaty will be \"coherent with and complementary to existing International Health Regulations\" and that it will \"reaffirm the principle of sovereignty of States Parties in addressing public health matters.\" Additionally, the treaty is being developed with input from member states and is expected to be agreed upon by governments, which suggests that it will not impose any significant restrictions on human rights or freedom of speech.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Sen. Joe Manchin's support for the Inflation Reduction Act could cost West Virginia 100,000 fossil fuel jobs. While it is true that the Inflation Reduction Act aims to reduce fossil fuel use and may lead to job losses in the industry, the 100,000 figure is exaggerated. According to the evidence, the number of direct fossil fuel jobs in West Virginia is estimated to be between 25,000 and 55,000, and some experts suggest that some jobs could be lost in the transition to non-fossil fuel energy. However, the exact number of job losses is uncertain and may not be as high as 100,000. Additionally, the claim implies that Manchin's support for the bill is the sole cause of the potential job losses, which is not accurate, as West Virginia has received significant federal funding in recent years and has been a favored target for federal dollars."

While the evidence suggests that Florida's spending has increased, the exact percentage of the increase is not provided. The evidence mentions a 31% increase in spending from all funds, but this is not specifically stated as a five-year increase. Additionally, the evidence highlights that tax revenue also increased by 28.9% during the same period, which may have contributed to the growth in spending.

While it is true that WVU has taken on additional debt during Gee's tenure, the evidence suggests that only about $300 million of the total debt ($877 million) stems from Gee-initiated projects, which is a much smaller proportion than the claimed 55%. The remaining $577 million consists of debts incurred before his current presidency or Gee-era refinancing of debts incurred before his tenure.

In fact, the evidence suggests that Republicans controlled both the legislative and executive branches in 2011 and drew gerrymandered districts, and it was not until 2023 that Speaker Vos announced support for a nonpartisan redistricting plan.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the repeal of Roe v. Wade has exacerbated the state's OB-GYN shortage as residency programs report a decline in enrollment due to the inability of residents to receive training in-state. While the evidence suggests that Wisconsin's OB-GYN residency programs did report a decline in enrollment, it is unclear whether this decline is directly caused by the repeal of Roe v. Wade. The evidence also suggests that the decline in enrollment may be part of a larger trend, as the number of medical school graduates who applied to residency positions decreased by about 2% nationwide during the 2022-23 application cycle. Additionally, the report from the Association of American Medical Colleges found that the decrease in OB-GYN applicants was highest in states with complete abortion bans, but it is unclear whether this is a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it is not entirely accurate to say that the repeal of Roe v. Wade is the sole cause of the decline in OB-GYN residency enrollment."

However, the claim also states that programs for food stamps, transportation, education, justice, environmental protection, and homelessness will not continue, which is FALSE. The evidence suggests that some of these programs may continue to operate for a short period or have carryover funds, but they are not guaranteed to continue indefinitely. Additionally, some programs may be affected by a government shutdown, such as WIC assistance, which may not have enough funding to support normal operations beyond a few days.

While it is true that the number of Medicaid participants increased during Biden's presidency, the claim that 20 million people are ineligible is inaccurate. Experts have stated that the number of people who could have been removed from Medicaid is still being processed and is not yet clear. Additionally, the Biden administration extended the public health emergency, which slowed down the removal process, and urged states to slow down their reviews to avoid incorrectly disqualifying would-be Medicaid recipients.

According to the evidence, the budget reduces the state's personal income tax rate by 21.25% in all tax brackets, which is a significant cut. However, the evidence also states that the state's current personal income tax rate is 4.75%, and the rate would be as low as 2.49% in 2033, a reduction of 2.26 percentage points.

The evidence suggests that the US has remained a net exporter of energy overall and petroleum specifically under Biden, which is a definition of energy independence. However, the claim is also partially false because it implies that the US has achieved a significant increase in energy independence under Biden, which is not supported by the evidence.

The Obama administration's bailout and restructuring of General Motors and Chrysler helped to stabilize the industry, and the industry was already showing signs of recovery by the time Trump took office.\n\nThe claim that Trump's tariffs and taxes saved the American auto industry from extinction is FALSE. While Trump did impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which may have had some positive effects on the industry, the majority of his policies had negative impacts on the industry.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"kids who don't even know what day it is or their colors can decide to permanently change themselves\" through medical gender transition. While it is true that children as young as three years old can express their gender identity and may receive gender-affirming care, the claim is exaggerated and misleading. The evidence suggests that gender-affirming care for minors typically involves a process of evaluation, consultation, and treatment that is tailored to the individual child's needs and circumstances. This process typically begins with social transitioning, such as using a preferred name or wearing certain clothes, and may extend to medical treatments such as puberty blockers or hormonal therapies as the child ages. Surgery is often the last step taken in a person's gender transition and is not typically performed on children who are still in the process of developing their gender identity. Additionally, the evidence suggests that medical gender transition treatment for young, prepubescent children is not possible, as it is not supported by medical guidelines and standards. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE because it is partially accurate but also misleading and exaggerated."

The evidence provided shows that Kim Jong Un did make a speech in which he criticized the Biden administration and mentioned the conflicts between Israel and Palestine, as well as Russia and Ukraine. However, there is no evidence that Kim Jong Un specifically blamed President Biden for these conflicts. Additionally, the claim states that Kim Jong Un expressed support for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, but the evidence only shows that Kim Jong Un mentioned Trump's name in the context of a speech, without explicitly endorsing him.

Additionally, the evidence also shows that China accounts for a smaller percentage of imports for other active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as 18% in 2019. Furthermore, the U.S. produces a significant amount of pharmaceutical ingredients domestically, and exports some to China.

The evidence mentions that the law included $400 million in election security grants, which states had to match with 20% of their own funds.

In fact, the evidence suggests that buying a gun from a licensed dealer in Maine is more complicated than buying Sudafed, as it requires a background check and the information of gun buyers is accessible to law enforcement. However, it is also true that there are some differences in the laws and regulations surrounding the sale of Sudafed and guns, such as the availability of guns in the U.S. and the lack of limits on the number of guns that can be purchased at one time.

Additionally, falling oil prices and an economic slowdown in China played more important roles in easing inflation over the past two-plus years. The evidence also suggests that the Inflation Reduction Act did not play a major role in reducing inflation in the last two years.

However, it is unclear if DeSantis was directly involved in recruiting Chinese companies or if he took any specific actions six months prior to the claim being made.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the vaccines are safe for pregnant women and that there is no clear evidence of any deaths in the U.S. caused by the vaccines. Additionally, the infant mortality rate rose in 2022, but this is not attributed to the vaccines, as the rate is higher in states with lower vaccination rates. The evidence also highlights the importance of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 deaths, particularly among older adults.

In fact, experts familiar with the FBI told PolitiFact that the term \"ghost bus\" is unfamiliar and that it would make no sense for the FBI to pack informants into a bus together because that would draw attention to them.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve's actions, such as raising interest rates, have also played a significant role in addressing inflation. The claim's assertion that the government's actions had \"nothing to do with getting our economy back in line\" is also disputed by the evidence, as the Federal Reserve's analysis suggests that government spending has contributed to higher inflation in the United States compared to other developed nations.

The Florida law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, makes it a third-degree felony for a doctor to perform or actively participate in an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, punishable by fines and up to five years in prison.

The American Farm Bureau reports that the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner fell this year, and prices are down for several items. However, the evidence also shows that the percentage of median income spent on Thanksgiving dinner has not decreased as much as one might expect, and in fact, it is higher than it was during the last pre-pandemic Thanksgiving in 2019. Therefore, while wages have risen, the claim that this Thanksgiving dinner is the fourth-cheapest ever as a percentage of average earnings is only partially true.

However, it is not entirely accurate because the United States has sometimes sought to establish military bases or maintain a military presence in the countries it has fought wars against. For example, the United States has maintained a military presence in Germany and Japan since the end of World War II, and has established military bases in countries such as South Korea and the Philippines.\n\nAdditionally, the claim is based on a narrow definition of \"land\" that only includes territory that is annexed or occupied, and does not account for other forms of territorial control or influence that the United States may exert. For example, the United States has exerted significant influence over the governments and economies of countries it has fought wars against, and has often played a major role in shaping the post-war order in these countries.\n\nOverall, while the claim is partially true, it is not entirely accurate and oversimplifies the complex and nuanced nature of the United States' military interventions and post-war policies."

However, the claim also implies that the government is saying that anyone born in the US is automatically an American citizen, regardless of their parents' immigration status. This is not entirely accurate, as the government has taken steps to clarify that children born to parents who are not legal immigrants or US citizens may not be automatically considered US citizens. The Trump administration has also proposed changes to birthright citizenship, which would deny citizenship to children born to parents who are unauthorized immigrants or temporary visa holders.

While the US Army has outlined a strategy to transition to electric vehicles, it does not plan to make all Army tanks electric. The evidence suggests that the Army is focusing on hybrid and nontactical vehicles, with some goals decades away.

However, the claim is also partially false because it implies that DeSantis personally made this statement, which is not supported by the evidence.

Additionally, the evidence shows that around 3.8-3.9 million people have been removed, returned, or expelled from the U.S. under Biden, which is a significant number, but not 142,000.

Additionally, the evidence highlights that safeguards exist to prevent non-citizen voting, such as the requirement to attest to citizenship when registering to vote.

The Trump ad's characterization of her plan as \"way too low, it must be much higher\" is an exaggeration, as she has not proposed raising the retirement age to an arbitrary high number.

Many countries, including some developed nations, allow abortions up to 20 weeks or later, often with exceptions for mental health or socioeconomic reasons. Additionally, some countries have laws that allow abortions up to 22-24 weeks.

However, the same report also states that the racial wealth gap widened in 2022 when measured by the difference in median wealth between white and nonwhite families. Additionally, the evidence highlights that the wealth gap is still significant, with the absolute-dollar median wealth for white families being $285,000 and just $45,000 for Black families.

The Biden administration has removed, returned, or expelled more than 4.5 million people during his presidency, which means that the actual number of people who have been allowed to stay in the country is likely lower than 8 million.

The 82% figure appears to be an exaggeration, as it includes all Americans eligible for Social Security benefits, not just those who would be affected by the plan.

Additionally, the claim is exaggerated, as Mayorkas is not solely responsible for the fentanyl crisis, and other factors, such as the president and Congress, also play a role in shaping border policies.

The evidence suggests that implantation of the fertilized egg, which is a crucial step in the process of becoming pregnant, can take several days to a week after conception, and it is only after implantation that hCG levels rise rapidly.

Additionally, the term \"extremists\" is not used in the evidence to describe the individuals or groups that would be affected by the law.

The actual tax rate paid by billionaires is likely higher, with some paying as high as 16% under current law.

Lincoln's name did not appear on the ballot in many Southern states because the Republican Party did not have a strong organization or voters in those areas.

White, who clarify that Lincoln was not removed from the ballot, but rather, his name was not included on the ballot in many states due to the lack of Republican Party presence. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

The prices mentioned in the evidence range from $7 to $489, and the exact same inhaler may not be available in both countries.

However, some of the retrieved evidence suggests that Biden has taken actions that could be seen as contributing to an increase in the number of immigrants in the country, such as his efforts to create a path for citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally and his administration's handling of the southern border. However, it is important to note that the evidence also suggests that Biden has taken steps to address concerns about illegal immigration, such as increasing funding for border officials and implementing deportation priorities.

According to the evidence, in June 2023, year-over-year inflation fell to 3%, and it has remained below 3.7% every month since. August 2024's rate was 2.5%, close to its pre-pandemic level and near the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.

According to the evidence, the cards are prepaid debit cards for \"immediate response\" purposes, specifically for food and baby supplies, and the amount is not specified. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the cards are not credit cards, but rather debit cards that can be used for specific purposes.

According to the evidence, food prices have risen 40% from April 2012 to today, and 60% from August 2007 to today, but these increases are over a longer period of time, not just \"a few years ago.\" Additionally, the evidence shows that some food categories have increased by less than 40%, such as chicken prices, which have increased 11% over the last year.

The White House and President Biden have repeatedly mentioned this figure, but it is based on private sector investments in clean energy and manufacturing, including semiconductor manufacturing, since 2020, not just the CHIPS and Science Act. The evidence also shows that some investments were announced before the legislation was passed, and it is difficult to separate the Act's effects on investments from other factors.

The evidence suggests that hormonal birth control may be associated with an increased risk of suicide, but the relationship is complex and not definitively causal. The study mentioned in the claim only found an association between hormonal birth control and suicide risk, and other experts have pointed out limitations in the study, such as the lack of control for other risk factors and the possibility of confounding variables. Additionally, the claim that hormonal birth control \"doubles risk of depression\" is not supported by the evidence, as the study only found an increased prevalence of depression among hormonal birth control users, but did not establish a causal link. The claim that hormonal birth control \"triples risk of suicide\" is also an exaggeration, as the study found a higher risk of suicide among former users, but not among current users.

While the evidence suggests that the Secretary of State does countersign official acts of the Governor, such as commissions and other official documents, it does not explicitly state that the Secretary of State countersigns acts passed by the legislature and signed into law by the Governor. The evidence does mention that the Secretary of State keeps a record of official acts of the legislature and executive department, but it does not mention countersigning acts passed by the legislature.

While it is true that prescription drug prices vary significantly between countries, the claim is an oversimplification. The evidence shows that the cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. is generally higher than in other developed countries, but there are exceptions. For example, the cost of unbranded generic drugs is actually lower in the U.S. compared to other countries. Additionally, the claim does not account for the complexity of international drug pricing, including factors such as regulatory differences, taxes, and insurance coverage.

However, the evidence also suggests that there are limitations and restrictions in place, such as the 1989 law in New York City that limited the information that city employees could give to federal immigration authorities. Additionally, the evidence mentions that there are certain crimes for which cooperation is permitted, but it does not specify that there are exactly 100 crimes.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not have an official policy regarding the participation of transgender athletes, and registration in men and women's boxing categories is based on what gender is listed on a participant's identifying documents, such as a passport. There is no evidence to suggest that the IOC has changed its policy to allow men to box against women in the Olympics.

According to the evidence, the debt under Biden's watch has risen by a little less than $6.7 trillion, which is smaller than Trump's total, but Biden is on pace to exceed Trump's mark by the end of his term. Additionally, the evidence shows that the debt has continued to rise under Biden, with the broadest measure of the federal debt standing at around $34.4 trillion, an increase of almost one-fourth in a little more than three years.

However, the claim needs context, as the evidence also shows that the national debt is still expected to increase by $14.4 trillion over the next 10 years, despite the deficit cuts. Additionally, the evidence highlights that the deficit reduction is not solely due to Biden's policies, as the single biggest driver of the national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Wisconsin has lost 6,000 manufacturing jobs and 455 dairy farms in the last year under Joe Biden's watch. The evidence suggests that the claim is partially true. According to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, the state lost 455 dairy farms in the last year, which matches the claim. However, the claim about manufacturing jobs is partially false. According to the St. Louis Fed, Wisconsin lost 2,300 manufacturing jobs, not 6,000. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the decline in manufacturing jobs is a long-term trend that predates Biden's presidency. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

However, the claim is also partially false because the warnings were not specifically about the eclipse itself, but rather about the expected influx of visitors and potential complications that might arise from it.

The Chinese government has a 1% stake in one of ByteDance's China-based subsidiaries, Beijing Douyin Information Service Co., but this is not the same as owning the company. Additionally, the evidence suggests that ByteDance has provided disclosures to Washington, D.C. courts, funders, and Chinese government documents, which show that 60% of TikTok is owned by global investors.

The evidence shows that in Miami, asylum claims were denied in about 73% of the 67,000 cases, which is close to the 90% mentioned in the claim.

However, the claim implies that there is something unusual or ominous about the eclipse, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the National Guard's assistance is a standard response to large-scale events, and the warnings about stockpiling supplies are typical advice given by emergency management officials in anticipation of large crowds.

Larger companies, such as multinational corporations, have paid for appeals bonds of $1 billion or more.

According to the Health Care Cost Institute, the average monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin in 2019 was $82, and among the 8.7% of individuals in the highest spending category, the median monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin was $315.

The evidence suggests that the judgment is a result of a civil fraud case, where Trump and his company were found liable for inflating the value of their assets, and the potential property seizure is a consequence of that judgment. This is not comparable to the actions of communist countries, where seizures are often done without due process or legal basis. The experts quoted in the evidence also disagree with Trump's comparison, stating that the case is not comparable to seizures in communist countries. Additionally, the evidence shows that the judgment was issued by a New York State Supreme Court Justice, and Trump has the legal right to appeal the decision. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

The evidence does not provide any credible link between the U.S. and the terror attack on Russian civilians. In fact, a senior defense official is quoted as saying that it is expected that the attack was carried out by Russia itself, and that the U.S. warning was simply a duty to warn, demonstrating that the U.S. takes no pleasure in the suffering of innocents, even if they are part of a nation considered an adversary.

The White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates stated that the date was not chosen intentionally, and the fact that Easter and Transgender Day of Visibility sometimes coincide due to the lunar calendar used to determine the date of Easter.

However, it is important to note that the Black Lives Matter movement is a decentralized global network, and it is not a single entity that can receive donations. The Claremont Institute's definition of \"Black Lives Matter related causes\" includes organizations and initiatives that advance one or more aspects of BLM's agenda, which may not necessarily be directly affiliated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.

The cap only applies after the beneficiary crosses the $2,000 annual threshold, and the plan pays the majority of the remaining cost, while Medicare and the drugmaker also share some of the cost.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"it's very misleading when (President Biden) says (inflation) used to be at 9%. This is compounding. It\u2019s not like it went down from 9% to 3%. This is building month after month. The better way to think about it is that it\u2019s 18%, 19% over the last three years.\" The evidence suggests that Biden's statement is partially accurate. While it is true that inflation has not decreased from 9% to 3% as Biden claimed, it is also true that the year-over-year inflation rate has fallen since its 2022 peak under Biden. Additionally, the cumulative inflation rate over the last three years is indeed higher than 9%. However, the claim is also misleading because it does not provide the full context of the inflation rate, which has fluctuated over time. Therefore, the verdict is HALF-TRUE."

The evidence shows that social media users have made claims about Swift's performances, but there is no credible evidence to back up these claims. Swift has publicly described herself as a Christian and has not engaged in any activities that suggest she is involved in satanic rituals.

The provision took effect on September 23, 2010, and it allowed young people to stay on their parents' health insurance until they turn 26.

The claim also states that over $500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn, which is partially true. The evidence suggests that the funds were not wasted, but rather were reprogrammed for other purposes. The claim is half-true because it contains some accurate information, but also contains some inaccuracies and exaggerations."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim says that the early polls were \"wildly incorrect\" in all three of Johnson's election campaigns. While the evidence suggests that the polls were indeed incorrect in at least two of the elections, it does not provide conclusive evidence that the polls were \"wildly incorrect\" in all three. Additionally, the evidence does not provide a clear definition of what \"wildly incorrect\" means, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

However, he has repeatedly called it a \"disaster\" and has supported repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress. Additionally, he has made statements that suggest he wants to replace it with an alternative.

The evidence suggests that the number of people living in the U.S. illegally is estimated to be around 14 million (as of March 2024) or 11 million (as of January 2022), which is within the range mentioned in the claim. However, the claim is not entirely accurate as it does not provide a specific number, and the estimates vary depending on the source and time frame. Additionally, the claim does not account for the dynamic nature of the number of people living in the U.S. illegally, which can fluctuate due to various factors such as immigration policies, border control, and demographic changes."

The evidence shows that the FBI has a written policy on the use of deadly force, which is typical for law enforcement agencies. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Biden's DOJ specifically authorized the use of deadly force in the Mar-a-Lago raid. The claim that Biden was \"locked and loaded\" and \"ready to take me out\" is likely an exaggeration or a fabrication, as there is no credible evidence to support this claim. The evidence suggests that the FBI agents involved in the raid were trained to use deadly force if necessary, but there is no indication that Biden was involved in the decision-making process or that he was physically present during the raid. Overall, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also contains significant exaggerations and inaccuracies."

The evidence shows that the loss of SALT deductibility did result in a financial hit to New Yorkers, but the $15 billion figure is disputed and may not accurately reflect the actual impact. Additionally, the claim that \"New Yorkers are paying more in taxes and receiving fewer services because of Donald Trump\" is also partially true, as the SALT cap did have a negative effect on New Yorkers relative to other states. However, the claim that this is the sole cause of the increased taxes and reduced services is not supported by the evidence, as other factors such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the COVID-19 pandemic also played a role.

However, Trump did impose sanctions on Russia, which may have contributed to the delay in the project's completion. Additionally, Biden did approve the project, but only after the pipeline was already largely complete. The claim that Biden \"shut down\" U.S. liquified natural gas export capacity is also partially true, as Biden paused new permits for LNG export projects to allow for more thorough reviews of their climate impacts. However, this did not shut down existing export capacity, and the U.S. is still exporting LNG. Overall, the claim is an oversimplification of complex events and policies."

The Fairness Doctrine was abolished in 1987, and Fox News launched in 1996. While the abolition of the Fairness Doctrine did contribute to a shift in the media landscape, it did not directly lead to the rise of Fox News. Additionally, the Fairness Doctrine would not have applied to Fox News as a cable network, as it was a broadcast regulation. The claim also implies a direct causal link between the two events, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that technological advancements, such as the rise of cable television, and the FCC's reconsideration of the Fairness Doctrine's relevance, played a more significant role in shaping the media landscape. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

While Merchan did sustain some objections from the defense and overrule some objections from the prosecution, the evidence does not suggest that he overruled every objection from the defense and sustained every objection from the prosecution. For example, on May 28, the defense raised at least 12 objections, and Merchan sustained five and overruled seven. Additionally, news reports show that objections from Trump's defense team were sustained multiple times, and some objections from the prosecution were overruled.

While Biden does propose to increase taxes on certain individuals, including billionaires, the claim that he wants to quadruple taxes is an exaggeration. According to the evidence, Biden's proposed tax increases would increase tax collections by about 7%, which is a significant increase, but not a quadrupling. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the majority of the tax increase would be paid by the top 5% of household earners, which is a relatively small portion of the population.

The evidence also mentions other factors that may have contributed to the decline, such as increased interceptions by Mexico, changes in U.S. policies, and the adaptability of migrants and smugglers.

Additionally, the evidence shows that wages have not kept pace with inflation over the past year, with inflation rising by nearly 20% since 2021 while wages have only risen by 12%.

Additionally, the evidence shows that Republicans in Wisconsin have proposed more restrictions on abortions since then.

While it is true that some Democrats, including President Joe Biden, support access to abortion throughout pregnancy, there is no evidence to suggest that they support or have voted for elective abortions up to and including the moment of birth.

Pelosi is expressing frustration and disappointment at the lack of accountability and preparedness, but she is not taking direct responsibility for the decision not to deploy the National Guard.

Additionally, legal experts have stated that the trial was not orchestrated to distract from Biden family crimes, but rather was a result of Hunter Biden's own actions.

While it is true that the Black unemployment rate hit a record low of 5.3% in August and September 2019, and the Black poverty rate hit a record low in 2019, it is not entirely accurate to say that these were the lowest rates ever recorded. The evidence suggests that the Black poverty rate has been trending downward since the 1960s, and other presidents, including Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton, Obama, and Biden, can also claim to have achieved record lows on Black poverty during their tenure. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that the Black unemployment rate has continued to decline under the Biden administration, with a record low of 4.8% in April 2023.

However, the claim also implies that Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to send weapons to Ukraine, which is not entirely accurate. Obama did reject Ukraine's request for lethal aid in 2014, but Biden's administration did provide extensive military aid to Ukraine, including weapons, after Russia's invasion in 2022.

Additionally, the evidence suggests that the increase in reported rapes is partly due to the expanded definition of rape and the increased willingness of victims to come forward, rather than an actual increase in the number of rapes.

The evidence provided shows that there have been instances of political violence in the past, such as the January 6th attack on the Capitol, the murder of George Floyd, and the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor.

Additionally, experts and fact-checking organizations have found no mention of IVF or specific recommendations to curtail the practice in the document. The plan's focus is on restricting some forms of emergency contraception and allowing employers to deny coverage of contraception based on moral or religious exemptions, but this is not the same as restricting access to IVF and contraception in general.

According to the evidence, Biden said Harris would lead U.S. diplomatic efforts and work with officials in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to stem migration to the U.S., which is a different role than being in charge of stopping illegal immigration.

In fact, she has said that \"we're not going to get rid of the police\" and that \"we all have to be practical.\" This suggests that while Harris may be open to reforming the police department and redirecting funding, she does not support complete defunding.

This means that wage increases have lagged behind price increases by a cumulative 1.7%, or less than half a percentage point per year.

The guidance document noted that race and ethnicity could put individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, but it was not the only consideration. Other factors such as age, medical conditions, and underlying health conditions were also taken into account. Additionally, the program was designed to ensure equitable distribution of treatments based on clinical need, and it did not discriminate against white people. The claim that being non-white gave a person more priority than having hypertension or other risk factors is also exaggerated and not supported by the evidence.

However, the evidence suggests that the March on Washington drew between 200,000 to 250,000 people, while Trump's speech on the Ellipse drew thousands, not hundreds of thousands. Additionally, Trump's claim that the crowd size was the same is likely an exaggeration or a misremembering, as he has been known to exaggerate his crowd sizes in the past.

Instead, he worked for American companies that had connections to Huawei, a Chinese company. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that Rogers was involved in deals to bring Chinese tech companies to the U.S. The claim is partially true because Rogers did work for companies with ties to China, but it is also misleading because it implies a direct connection between Rogers and Chinese tech companies that is not supported by the evidence."

According to the evidence, the number of union members went from 14,012,000 in 2021 to 14,424,000 in 2023, which is an increase of about 412,000. This increase is close to, but not exactly, 400,000.

The Inflation Reduction Act did make changes to Medicare Part D, which could potentially lead to higher premiums and fewer benefits for older Americans. However, the evidence also suggests that the law aimed to reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years and lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. The law's provisions were phased in over several years, and it's unclear whether the changes would have a significant impact on Medicare benefits in the short term.

The plan is intended to help low- and moderate-income individuals, including those who may be undocumented immigrants, achieve homeownership. However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that Harris is targeting illegal aliens specifically, which is not the case.

The Center for American Progress' calculations show that the committee's proposed retirement age increase would affect an estimated 73% of Arizonans, but this is not a direct quote or statement from Kari Lake or Project 2025.

The evidence also shows that other factors such as increased demand, supply chain issues, and rising costs are also contributing to the price increases.

The funding was not specifically for hiring agents to go after tip income, but rather for expanding the IRS workforce to improve tax compliance and enforcement. Additionally, the claim implies that the new hires would be targeting tip income, which is not accurate. The IRS has always required workers to report their tips as income, and the new funding is intended to improve the agency's ability to collect taxes owed, not to target specific types of income.

The plan is aimed at taxing the wealthy, and it would apply to households with incomes above $400,000. The tax would be on the unrealized gains, not on the property itself. The claim is also misleading because it implies that the tax would be on the increased value of the house, which is not accurate. The tax would be on the unrealized gains, which could be from various assets, not just real estate.

Many experts, including economists and studies, argue that tariffs ultimately hurt consumers by raising prices and distorting the market, and that the benefits of higher wages are often outweighed by the costs to consumers.

The order of names on the ballot is determined by the party's primary election results, and it is a common practice for candidates to perform better when their name appears first on the ballot. However, the claim that the order of names is a \"clear attempt at voter manipulation\" is an exaggeration and lacks concrete evidence to support it.

Additionally, the project would block grant Title I (about 2% of school spending) and reduce it over a decade. However, it would not completely eliminate funding for K-12 schools. The claim is half-true because it is partially accurate, but also misleading in its implication that Project 2025 would completely eliminate funding for K-12 schools."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states\" this month. While it is true that non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in several states, the evidence provided does not support the claim that this specific number of non-citizens was removed in just 3 states this month. The evidence suggests that the removals occurred over a longer period, with some states removing tens of thousands of ineligible voters, but not necessarily all in the same month. Additionally, the evidence does not provide a clear breakdown of the number of non-citizens removed in each of the 3 states mentioned. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE, as it is partially accurate but lacks specific details to support the exact claim."

The evidence suggests that the proposal was not leaked, but rather was a plan that was in its final stages and was publicly rolled out by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The plan was not fully developed, but it was not a half-baked idea that was leaked. The governor's office did try to distance himself from the proposal, but this was likely due to the controversy surrounding it rather than any lack of readiness. Overall, the claim is half-true because while the proposal was not fully developed, it was not a leaked idea that was not ready for prime time."

However, the evidence suggests that Harris has not detailed a pathway to citizenship plan, and it would take years for immigrants to become eligible for Social Security benefits. Additionally, immigrants in the U.S. illegally are currently ineligible for Social Security retirement benefits, and it is unclear whether a pathway to citizenship would help or hurt Social Security's solvency. The claim is partially true because it is true that Harris has not detailed a pathway to citizenship plan, but it is also partially false because it implies that immigrants would immediately become eligible for Social Security benefits, which is not the case."

The amendment would still prohibit the state from restricting abortion access before fetal viability, which is a significant limitation.

While it is true that some transgender youth may undergo gender-affirming surgeries, this is not a common or immediate occurrence. The evidence provided suggests that gender-affirming care for children may include non-medical interventions such as using chosen names and pronouns, and that medical interventions are typically only considered under the guidance of a healthcare provider and with the consent of the child and their parents. Additionally, the evidence suggests that gender-affirming care is not a sudden or immediate process, but rather a process that may involve multiple steps and consultations over time. The claim is also misleading in that it implies that schools are making decisions about a child's gender identity and medical treatment without the involvement of parents, which is not accurate. While some schools may have policies in place to support transgender students, the decision to pursue gender-affirming care is typically made in consultation with a healthcare provider and with the consent of the child and their parents."

The evidence suggests that Brown has generally supported LGBTQ+ rights, including allowing transgender athletes to participate in sports and supporting access to gender-affirming care, but it does not provide direct evidence of his support for the specific procedures mentioned in the claim.

Moreno has not consistently held the same stance on exceptions throughout his political career, and his current views on the issue are unclear. While he has expressed support for a national abortion ban in the past, he has also stated that he believes abortion is \"mostly an issue for the states\" and has not clearly stated his position on a national ban with no exceptions.

The rate rose in 2022, but in 2023, it hit its lowest point since 2015. Additionally, the county health data does not support the claim that Haitian immigrants are having a significant impact on disease rates in the county, as the data is not reported by demographics such as race, ethnicity, nationality, or immigration status.

The claim's statement that \"without definitions these words can mean almost anything\" is an exaggeration, as the evidence shows that words like \"abortion,\" \"health care provider,\" and others have understood meanings in ordinary usage.

The evidence shows that the city's final budget exceeded the tax cap twice, and both times, the budget was passed with a veto-proof majority.

However, the claim oversimplifies Trump's actions and implies that he actively worked to improve the law, which is not accurate. Trump's statements and actions were often contradictory, and he did not have a clear plan to improve the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The FBI is investigating the event as an assassination attempt, and numerous credible news reports and official accounts confirm that it was a real attempt on Trump's life. The claim is contradicted by the evidence, which includes eyewitness accounts, news reports, and official statements from law enforcement agencies.

The evidence provided does not support this claim. While Sen. Baldwin has cosponsored legislation related to LGBTQ+ issues, including gender-affirming care, there is no evidence that she has given taxpayer money to a clinic that does gender-affirming care without informing parents.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the plus sign is intended to recognize people who are not captured within or represented by the LGBTQ+ acronym, and that LGBTQ+ advocates and organizations do not support or recognize pedophilia as a legitimate sexual orientation. The evidence also debunks the claim that LGBTQ+ leaders are recognizing pedophiles as part of the community, and that this is a false and harmful stereotype. Additionally, the evidence shows that pedophilia is not a sexual orientation and is considered a disorder by many mental health professionals. Therefore, the claim that the plus in LGBTQ+ includes pedophilia is FALSE."

However, Casey did vote for the American Rescue Plan in 2021, which economists said helped worsen inflation. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate, but also misleading and incomplete.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"We're bankrupting a lot of hospitals by forcing these hospitals to provide care for people who don't have the legal right to be in our country\" is partially true. While it is true that hospitals are required to provide emergency care to anyone, regardless of their immigration status, the claim implies that this is the primary cause of financial strain on hospitals. However, the evidence suggests that the actual impact of uncompensated care on hospitals is more complex and influenced by various factors, including the overall healthcare system, insurance coverage, and government programs. Additionally, some evidence suggests that immigrants in the country illegally may actually contribute to the healthcare system through taxes and other means, which could offset some of the costs. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is an oversimplification of the issue and does not accurately convey the complexity of the situation."

The evidence suggests that the school district has hired interpreters, but it does not specify that each student has a private interpreter.

Specifically, it suggests breaking up NOAA, commercializing forecast operations, and limiting the agency's independence from the executive branch. Additionally, it proposes shifting the National Weather Service's focus away from climate change initiatives and towards data gathering, which could potentially lead to a reduction in the agency's scope and capabilities.

However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that Harris supports providing taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens, which is not entirely accurate.

Additionally, the signature on the presidential stationery is not a signature used for official purposes, but rather a keepsake given to attendees of White House events. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as Jill Biden did participate in a Cabinet meeting, but did not lead it and the signature on the stationery is not used for official purposes."

According to the evidence, President Barack Obama oversaw a debt increase of more than $9.5 trillion during his two terms, which exceeds Trump's one-term total. However, Trump did add the most debt per year served in office, with an increase of almost $2 trillion per year.

For example, one source states that manufacturing jobs fell by 48,000 from its prepandemic peak in January 2019 to February 2020, which is a quarter of the number claimed by Harris. Additionally, another source notes that the number of jobs created under Trump would have been higher had a pandemic not hit during his term.

The State Board of Elections explained the removals, and experts confirmed that the move appeared to be normal voter roll cleanup, which is required by state law.

Instead, he has called it a \"disaster\" and has promised to replace it with an alternative.

Caterpillar, one of the companies mentioned, actually added 8,600 U.S. jobs during Ayotte's board service, offsetting the loss of 1,200 jobs.

However, the evidence also shows that Americans in Israel were offered chartered flights to leave the country, but they were asked to sign an agreement to repay the U.S. government prior to departure. This means that the claim is partially true, as Americans in Lebanon are being offered loans to pay for flights, while Americans in Israel were not being offered free flights, but were instead asked to repay the U.S. government. The claim's assertion that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year \"on our dime\" is also partially true, as the U.S. government has been providing aid to Israel's military, but the evidence does not specifically state that the U.S. government has been paying for chartered flights for Israeli citizens.

Furthermore, the evidence highlights that the tax rate for billionaires is more than 3%, and that even if a teacher or firefighter paid at the highest of these estimates (15%), it would still be below the 16% paid by the top 25 billionaires. Therefore, the claim that teachers, nurses, and firefighters pay a higher tax rate than billionaires and large corporations is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half\" is partially supported by the evidence. While there are statements from officials, such as Harris, claiming that the flow of fentanyl has been cut in half, there is no concrete data or evidence to back up this claim. Additionally, experts like Joseph Palamar point out that it's difficult to determine the exact amount of fentanyl coming into the country, making it challenging to verify the claim. The evidence suggests that fentanyl overdoses are a significant issue, and efforts to interdict and seize the drug are underway, but the claim of a 50% reduction in flow is not supported by concrete data."

However, the evidence provided suggests that it is unlikely that Trump has visited Gaza. The evidence includes statements from Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, who said that no president has visited Gaza since Bill Clinton, largely due to security concerns. Additionally, a Trump campaign official stated that Gaza is in Israel, and another official said that if Trump has visited Gaza, it must have been before 2006. Furthermore, the evidence does not provide any credible evidence of Trump's visit to Gaza. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

The evidence provided shows that Milwaukee has a higher number of allegations of child sex trafficking compared to other cities, but it is not clear if this is the highest in the country.

The only mention of Lake opposing something related to the child tax credit is a mention of her opposing the American Rescue Plan, which included the child tax credit expansion, but it is not clear if she specifically opposed the expansion itself.

However, the changes were made in a legal and transparent process, and the state's Board of Elections, which includes both Democratic and Republican members, voted unanimously to implement the changes. The changes were also aimed at ensuring that displaced voters could exercise their right to vote, rather than to manipulate the outcome of the election. While some might argue that the changes were unnecessary or could have been implemented differently, there is no evidence to suggest that the changes were made with the intention of cheating or stealing the election.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plan is worth $4 trillion.

Instead, it appears that the allegations were made through a social media post by an account called Black Insurrectionist, which shared a story about a former student who alleged that Walz had sexually abused him in the 1990s.

Additionally, Casey voted 99-0 in favor of a bill that increased funding for two federal public safety grant programs in 2021. This suggests that Casey has not consistently voted to \"defund the police\" and has instead supported funding for law enforcement.

The directive only reiterates existing policy regarding the level of approval needed to exercise existing legal authorities, and the use of lethal force is permitted only in specific circumstances, such as self-defense, defense of others, or protection of assets vital to national security.

On the other hand, he has also stated that he believes the government should negotiate with Big Pharma to lower drug prices. Additionally, he has proposed increasing price transparency and requiring health insurers to disclose their negotiated drug rebates and discounts.

According to the evidence, Michigan has 8,441,536 registered voters, but the number of eligible voters is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that the number of registered voters includes inactive voters, which means that the actual number of eligible voters is likely lower. Additionally, the evidence suggests that some noncitizens may be registered to vote due to misunderstandings or errors, which could contribute to the discrepancy between registered voters and eligible citizens.

Federal law rarely dictates who is eligible for specific sports. The claim is also misleading because it implies that Rosen voted to allow biological men to compete in women's sports, which is not accurate.

In fact, state officials and experts state that if a ballot includes both a small mark and a selection box that's fully filled in for the same office, the vote would be counted for the fully marked candidate. Additionally, county officials have the leeway to determine voter intent in cases of overvotes, which means that even if a ballot has a small dot and a full box, the full box could be interpreted as the voter's selection.

The evidence provided suggests that shutdowns can cost the economy billions of dollars, but it also notes that the cost is often measured in gross domestic product (GDP) and that the impact may be modest in the context of a large economy like the United States. Additionally, some experts have estimated that the 2013 shutdown stunted fourth-quarter GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points, resulting in a $20 billion hit to the economy. However, other experts have cautioned that calculating the cost of a shutdown is complicated and that the actual cost may be higher or lower than estimated. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The county is not waiving or reducing property taxes for homes damaged by Hurricane Helene, as state law prohibits it from doing so.

The evidence suggests that the claim is a conspiracy theory with no basis in fact. Multiple sources, including experts and reputable news outlets, have debunked the claim, stating that the wildfires were not caused by a deliberate government effort to clear land for smart cities. Instead, the evidence points to natural causes, such as climate change, as the primary driver of the wildfires. Additionally, the claim is inconsistent with the facts, as it would require a massive and coordinated effort by the government to intentionally set fires and risk people's lives, which is not a feasible or plausible scenario. The claim is also inconsistent with the actions of government officials, who have consistently emphasized the need to address climate change and prevent wildfires, rather than using them as a means to achieve some other goal.

Furthermore, the article mentions that \"counties have provided regular updates about the ballots left to be counted in the race, so it\u2019s clear where the ballots are coming from.\" This suggests that the counting process is transparent and not suspicious.

According to the evidence, Wisconsin ranks as the fifth-hardest state to vote in the country, behind New Hampshire, Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi. Additionally, the evidence highlights other factors that can make it difficult for people to vote, such as the redistricting process and the rules for voting in the 2024 presidential election.

The evidence also includes quotes from politicians and experts who mention the broad public support for voter ID laws. While there may be some variation in the exact percentage of support, the overall trend is clear that a majority of the public supports voter ID laws.

The article quotes experts saying that the claim is a massive exaggeration and that the couple's water rights amount to a tiny percentage of California's overall water.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"California wildfires have nothing to do with climate change\" is partially true, but not entirely accurate. While some of the evidence suggests that the specific wildfires mentioned may not be directly caused by climate change, other evidence suggests that climate change can contribute to the conditions that make wildfires more likely to occur. For example, a study mentioned in the evidence states that climate change makes the region warmer and the vegetation drier, which can increase the risk of wildfires. Additionally, experts have stated that while natural climate fluctuations have occurred throughout history, the current changes are unrelated to those natural fluctuations and are likely caused by human activities. Therefore, while the claim is partially true in the sense that some wildfires may not be directly caused by climate change, it is also partially false in that climate change can still play a role in the conditions that lead to wildfires."

Additionally, the evidence suggests that there is ongoing debate among legal scholars about whether the amendment can be considered part of the Constitution, with some arguing that the ratification deadline is unconstitutional and others considering the argument flawed.

This suggests that Milwaukee Public Schools' tax levy is indeed larger than the City of Milwaukee's tax levy after the referendum. However, the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that the school district's tax levy is larger than the city's tax levy at all times, which is not supported by the evidence.

Instead, the evidence indicates that the hotline has always prioritized obtaining victims' consent before reporting tips to law enforcement, and that it has been taking a victim-centered approach for many years. The only mention of a potential change came in a 2023 letter signed by multiple state attorneys general, which recounted comments from a hotline executive who said the service was \"beginning to transition away\" from serving as a tip line.

The evidence includes quotes from a CNN spokesperson, screenshots of CNN's video reports and articles, and a search of CNN's news archive, which all confirm that CNN's reports came after the crash. Additionally, publication data from other news organizations that republish CNN's wire content corroborate that CNN's reports came after the crash. The claim that CNN reported on the crash \"hours before it happened\" is therefore FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"we'll have the capacity to continue to do there what we've always done. We've always had a presence of illegal immigrants there that have been detained.\" The evidence suggests that the US has indeed held migrants at Guant\u00e1namo Bay in the past, specifically in the 1990s, and has used it as a detention center for immigration enforcement. However, the claim implies that this is a common practice, which is not entirely accurate. The Trump administration's approach is different from previous uses, as it involves sending people who were detained on U.S. soil to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, whereas previously, the migrants were intercepted at sea. Additionally, the administration's plans to detain 30,000 people, which is a significant increase from previous numbers, and the uncertainty surrounding the length of detention and conditions at the facility, suggest that this is not simply a continuation of a long-standing practice. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Ring is \"alerting people about (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids\" is partially true. While Ring's Neighbors app does allow users to post about police, fire, and ambulance activity, including ICE activity, it does not directly alert users about ICE raids. The evidence suggests that the screenshot circulating online appears to be a notification from a user who posted about ICE activity in their neighborhood, not a notification from Ring itself. Additionally, Ring's guidelines prohibit posting political content or promoting/attacking ideologies, which may limit the types of posts about ICE activity that are allowed on the app. Therefore, while Ring does allow users to share information about ICE activity, it is not directly alerting people about ICE raids."

    "[VERDICT]: FALSE  \n[REASON]: The evidence suggests that the claim is false. The government websites did not update with a nine-star flag that represents the Confederacy. The flag icon used on government websites is a design choice and not an actual flag used by the government or the Confederacy. The number of stars was a design decision based on the flag icon's limited size and represents no past or current flags. Additionally, the flag icon has been in use since 2017 and was used throughout both the Trump and Biden administrations. There is no evidence to support the claim that the government updated the flag to represent the Confederacy."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid\" is partially true. According to the evidence, USAID funding does go to local organizations in foreign countries, and 10-30 cents on the dollar is the range mentioned. However, the evidence also suggests that not all of the funding goes directly to local organizations, as some of it is distributed through international organizations and companies, which may not necessarily be based in the countries receiving the aid. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is accurate in part but not entirely accurate in its characterization of how USAID funding is distributed."

However, the evidence suggests that Zelenskyy did not make such a statement. Instead, he mentioned that Ukraine received \"just over\" $75 billion in military aid, which is less than half of the total aid allocated. Additionally, the evidence shows that not all of the aid has been spent, and some of it is being used for purposes other than military support. While there are allegations of corruption and embezzlement, there is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy personally misused the aid or that the entire operation is a \"money laundering\" scheme. The claim is exaggerated and misleading."

While it is true that Kingsbury was the one who first noticed Mahomes in 2012 and believed in him, it is not entirely accurate to say that Kingsbury recruited Mahomes. According to Mahomes himself, he received only a few offers from smaller schools in the Texas area, and Kingsbury was the one who came down to see him, talked to him, and believed in him, which ultimately led to Mahomes choosing Texas Tech. So, while Kingsbury played a significant role in Mahomes' recruitment, it was not a traditional recruitment process where Kingsbury actively recruited Mahomes to join Texas Tech."

The full interview was 45 minutes long, and the aired interview was edited down to 20 minutes. The same three-and-a-half-minute exchange on U.S.-Israel relations was used in both the preview clip and the aired interview, with no evidence of any answers being replaced.

However, the evidence suggests that FEMA did not directly give money to luxury hotels, but rather to New York City, which then used the funds to house migrants. Additionally, the money did not come from the Disaster Relief Fund, but rather from a separate program funded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. While the claim is partially accurate in that FEMA did provide funding for migrant housing, it is misleading in its characterization of the funding source and the purpose of the funding.

The bill would require additional documentation, such as a birth certificate or passport, to prove citizenship, which could be a challenge for some individuals, especially those who lack a passport or have changed their name through marriage.

However, the claim also states that this represents a 46% increase since Biden took office, which is not accurate.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that President Joe Biden \"fired\" 14,000 Keystone XL pipeline workers \"on day one\" of his administration is partially true. While it is accurate that Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, the claim that 14,000 workers were fired on that day is not entirely accurate.\n\nAccording to the evidence, TC Energy, the company behind the project, \"let go 1,000 workers in both the U.S. and Canada\" one day after Biden revoked the permit. This suggests that the layoffs occurred after the permit was revoked, not on the same day. Additionally, estimates vary on the number of jobs the Keystone XL pipeline would have created, and it is unclear how many workers would have been employed by the project if it had been completed.\n\nTherefore, while Biden's decision to revoke the permit did lead to job losses, the claim that 14,000 workers were fired on his first day in office is an exaggeration. The correct statement would be that Biden's decision to revoke the permit led to job losses, but the exact number of workers affected is unclear."

While the evidence suggests that the legislation in question does not directly increase bank fees, it does repeal a regulation that would have capped overdraft fees at lower levels. This means that banks could potentially increase overdraft fees if the legislation passes. However, the claim is also exaggerated, as it implies that the legislation directly increases bank fees, which is not the case. The evidence suggests that the legislation would maintain the status quo and not increase current overdraft fees. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

While the evidence suggests that around 90% of districts have some sort of restrictive cellphone policy in place, it is important to note that this policy may not necessarily be a blanket ban on cellphones during class time. The evidence also suggests that some districts allow students to use cellphones in certain areas, such as common areas or during passing time, and that some districts have exceptions for emergencies or health care.

Additionally, the Marine Corps Recruiting Command reported that recruiters outperformed the first five months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the same timeframe the previous year, which was before Trump took office.
