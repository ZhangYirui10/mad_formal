    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Gas prices were WAY higher in 2008, under REPUBLICAN president George W. Bush\" is partially true. According to the evidence, the highest gas prices in the past 20 years did occur in July 2008, during the Bush administration, with prices reaching around $4.11 per gallon. However, the claim is also misleading because it does not provide the full context of the situation. The evidence shows that gas prices were also low during the Bush administration, particularly after the 9/11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Additionally, the claim implies that the president has a direct impact on gas prices, which is not supported by the evidence. The price of gasoline is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including the state of the economy, global supply and demand, and OPEC's production decisions. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE because it is partially accurate but also misleading and oversimplifies the complex factors that affect gas prices."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that if you don't comply with getting a COVID-19 vaccination and you're on Social Security or disability, you won't be able to receive your money. However, the evidence provided shows that there is no such vaccination requirement in place and no proposed legislation that ties Social Security benefits to vaccination status. The claim is based on a misleading interpretation of a Senate floor discussion, where Senator Rick Scott introduced a bill to prohibit requiring vaccination as a condition of receiving Social Security benefits, but there is no actual policy or law that would result in the loss of benefits for non-compliance. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that N.C. Attorney General Josh Stein has gone after Jan. 6 protesters but has \"said nothing\" about violent summer protests in North Carolina and was \"derelict in his duty.\" While it is true that Stein did not prosecute the Jan. 6 protesters, as it was a federal case, the claim is partially false because Stein did take action in response to the Jan. 6 insurrection. He invited the public to report information and referred tips to the FBI. Additionally, Stein signed a letter with other attorneys general to repair the damage done to institutions and build a more perfect union. On the other hand, the claim is partially true because Stein did not publicly speak out or prosecute those involved in the violent summer protests in North Carolina. However, it is important to note that the claim is also misleading because it implies that Stein was derelict in his duty to prosecute the summer protesters, which is not accurate. Stein's role in the summer protests was limited to referring tips to the FBI, which is a standard procedure."

Specifically, the map splits Pulaski County, which is the largest county in the state and has a diverse population, into three different congressional districts. This is a departure from past practice and has been criticized by political analysts and even the state's Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, who expressed concerns about the impact on minority populations. The map also appears to have been designed to dilute the impact of the minority vote in the 2nd district, which was previously a somewhat competitive seat. Overall, the evidence suggests that the map is a gerrymander that does not prioritize keeping communities together."

While the Justice Department has taken steps to address threats against school officials, including the creation of a task force and the involvement of the National Security Division, there is no evidence that the Patriot Act is being used to label parents as domestic terrorists. The evidence suggests that the Justice Department is focusing on threats of violence or intimidation, which is a different legal standard than domestic terrorism. Additionally, the Justice Department has stated that it would not use the Patriot Act in this context, and experts have noted that the law is not relevant to the issue at hand. However, the claim is also partially true in that some lawmakers, such as Rep. Steve Chabot, have made statements suggesting that the Justice Department is using the Patriot Act to target parents who are exercising their First Amendment rights.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Democrats are \"asking for a blank check book to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions\" is partially true. While it is true that Democrats have proposed increasing the debt ceiling to allow for continued spending, the notion that this is a \"blank check\" is a misconception. According to Iowa State University economics professor Joydeep Bhattacharya, the debt ceiling is the limit on how much the U.S. government can spend before getting authorization to spend again, and raising the debt ceiling does not authorize new spending. Instead, it allows for the government to continue spending on programs that have already been authorized. Additionally, new spending proposals must still go through Congress. Therefore, while Democrats are seeking to increase the debt ceiling to allow for continued spending, it is not a \"blank check\" that allows them to spend as much as they want without repercussions."

The Spanish High Court did not make such an announcement, and the claim is not supported by credible sources. The evidence presented by the claimants is based on a misinterpretation of a request for information from a citizen, which was answered by the Spanish Ministry of Health, and ignores other explanations for why the agency did not provide a sample of the virus. Additionally, the claim ignores the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated in laboratories around the world, including in Spain, and that the World Health Organization has confirmed its existence.

While Florida did gain 84,500 jobs in September, the claim exaggerates the proportion of jobs gained by Florida. According to the evidence, Florida accounted for 43.8% of the nation's job growth, not almost half as claimed by DeSantis. Additionally, the evidence notes that the comparison between Florida's job growth and the nation's is not entirely apples-to-apples due to differences in how the numbers are calculated."

While it is true that the Department of Justice has formed a task force to examine how federal enforcement tools could be used to prosecute violent threats and crimes directed at school district personnel, the evidence does not suggest that the FBI is targeting parents who speak out against critical race theory specifically. The memo from the Department of Justice does not mention critical race theory, and the threats mentioned in the National School Boards Association's letter were not limited to those who spoke out against critical race theory. Additionally, the FBI is not targeting parents who engage in \"spirited debate\" or peaceful protests, but rather those who make violent threats or engage in criminal conduct. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate in that the Department of Justice is taking action to address violent threats and crimes, but it is misleading in its implication that the FBI is targeting parents who speak out against critical race theory."

The evidence also points to other factors such as a shortage of truckers, warehouse workers, and base materials, as well as congestion at the ports, ships waiting to be unloaded, and a lack of warehouse space, which contribute to the supply chain problems.

While some reports have mentioned the possibility of toxic substances, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim. The FBI and Better Business Bureau have not issued any alerts about unsolicited packages or toxic masks, and Snopes fact-checkers found that a similar claim from 2020 was unverified.

While it is true that North Carolina's gas prices increased 14 cents per gallon between Oct. 17 and Oct. 24, according to GasBuddy.com, it is not necessarily the highest in the nation. AAA's data shows that the national average price for a gallon of gasoline had risen six cents since Oct. 18 to hit $3.38 for a gallon of unleaded, and North Carolina's price increase was not the highest among the states tracked by AAA.

However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that booster shots are not a legitimate or effective way to extend the protection provided by vaccines. In reality, booster shots are a standard part of many vaccination schedules, including for diseases such as tetanus, and are designed to maintain immunity and prevent the spread of disease.

The analysis was specific to a campaign promise by Joe Biden to ban oil and gas operations on federal lands and water, which was not implemented. However, the actual pause on leasing was brief due to a federal court order, and current oil and gas production was not impacted. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that residential non-renewable energy expenditures will increase by $18 billion (in 2020 dollars) from $247 billion to $265 billion, which is close to the $19 billion figure mentioned in the claim.

The evidence provided by Rep. Gwen Moore and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that the federal tax code taxes about 5.8 million low-wage workers into or deeper into poverty, exceeding the Earned Income Tax Credit they receive. However, the claim does not account for the fact that not all low-wage workers are single and childless. The evidence from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Christopher Wimer, senior research scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Poverty & Social Policy, suggests that single workers are more likely to earn the federal minimum wage or less, but it does not provide a comprehensive picture of all low-wage workers, including those with children.

While it is true that Fairfax County is not requiring the last four digits of Social Security Numbers on actual absentee ballots, the claim is half-true because the lawsuit in question was about absentee ballot applications, not absentee ballots.

Experts on election administration have criticized the group's methodology, pointing out that the canvassers visited residences up to a year after the election, which would have resulted in inaccurate information, and that the group did not explain how they chose the counties and areas they canvassed.

The claim states that those who served in the military before 2002 get an additional $1,200 a year ($100 per month) in Social Security, but this is not accurate. According to the evidence, the amount of extra credits added to the earnings record varies depending on the length of military service and which years the person was in the military. Additionally, the claim implies that the additional earnings credit directly affects the monthly Social Security benefit, which is not the case. The Social Security Administration notes that the additional earnings are credited to the earnings that are averaged over a person's working lifetime, not directly to their monthly benefit amount. However, it is true that some military veterans who served from 1940 to 2001 are eligible to have extra Social Security wage credits added to their earnings record, which may result in higher monthly Social Security payments."

The evidence provided suggests that the charges brought against those involved in the riot are related to specific actions they took on that day, and there is no indication that the government is targeting a large group of people based on their political beliefs or affiliation with a particular political party.

While Uttar Pradesh did report a significant decline in cases, it is unclear whether ivermectin was the sole reason for this decline. The state's low case count may be attributed to a combination of factors, including widespread vaccination, mask-wearing, and social distancing measures. Additionally, experts have questioned the credibility of the claim, citing the lack of peer-reviewed randomized control studies and the potential for underreporting of cases. Therefore, while ivermectin may have played a role in the decline of cases, it is not the sole cause, and the claim is therefore HALF-TRUE."

He was indicted on federal charges because investigators found he brought a gun with him onto Capitol grounds and then made false statements to federal agents in a recorded interview.

Instead, the department sent a letter to pass along information about court rulings, and it does encourage mask wearing in accordance with CDC and ADHS guidelines. The department has no authority to give a green light to policies, and it does not support Critical (Race) Theory.

The video shows that the voter was having trouble casting a vote for the Republican candidate, but it also appears to work when the voter touches the name of the Democratic candidate. Additionally, the county's superintendent of elections stated that the issue was not widespread and that voters have the ability to double-check their votes before casting their ballots, which is a safeguard to protect the integrity of the vote.

The study's title states that a mortality rate \"close to zero\" could theoretically be achieved at 50 ng/mL, but does not claim that it has been achieved. Additionally, subsequent research has been mixed and has not consistently supported the claim that vitamin D levels of 50 ng/mL are correlated with zero mortality rate from COVID.

For instance, in 1969, Linwood Holton became the first Republican to win Virginia's governorship in 100 years, while Richard Nixon was the president. Similarly, in 2013, Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, won the governorship while Barack Obama was the president.

The study found that the spike protein hinders the recruitment of specific proteins involved in DNA repair, but it does not directly impair DNA repair itself.

The evidence also highlights that the bill excludes non-infrastructure elements, such as research and development, domestic manufacturing, clean energy tax credits, and capital investments in housing, schools, child care centers, veterans hospitals, and other federal buildings. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's categorization of the bill's spending also supports this conclusion, showing that the majority of the bill's spending is dedicated to traditional infrastructure provisions.

However, the claim that new Legislative maps could be drawn to \"represent that 50-50 split\" is not entirely accurate.

While it is true that vaccinated people can still get COVID-19, the evidence suggests that unvaccinated people are far more likely to catch and spread the virus, and are at a higher risk of being hospitalized or dying. The claim is also supported by the fact that the virus spread widely in the spring and fall of 2020, before vaccines were widely available, and that the delta variant was first detected in an unvaccinated population. However, it is also true that vaccinated people can still get COVID-19, and that some vaccinated people may be at risk of getting severe cases of COVID-19 due to immune system deficiencies.

The New Jersey state Division of Elections notes that provisional ballots are intended for voters \"whose eligibility to vote cannot be confirmed at the polls on Election Day.\" The poll worker in the video says she is unsure of the man's eligibility but will provide a ballot so that his eligibility can be assessed later, as the law allows.

Hinson and Miller-Meeks did not vote against the entire bill, but rather against the additional $550 billion in new spending. They did not explicitly state that they were denying rural Iowans broadband internet. In fact, Miller-Meeks listed broadband as a priority in her press release, and Hinson supported the existing spending on broadband.

However, the evidence suggests that the average job gain during the five months prior to Biden's presidency was around 321,000, and the average job gain during his presidency was around 620,000. This means that the claim is partially true, as the job gains did increase under Biden, but the exact numbers are exaggerated. The claim also states that 4,000 people a day were dying from Covid under the previous administration, and that this number is now down 75%. The evidence suggests that the number of daily deaths was not publicly reported, but the claim is likely referring to the peak of around 3,000-4,000 daily deaths in January 2021. The evidence also suggests that the number of daily deaths has decreased significantly under the Biden administration, but the exact percentage decrease is not provided.

The presentation aimed to help teachers develop solutions to address the issue of disproportionate suspension rates, particularly affecting Black students. The Virginia Department of Education's effort was focused on combating racism in disciplinary procedures and increasing awareness of the social and emotional needs of students affected by news of blackface.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the media televised the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse \"because he is a \u2018white supremacist shooter\u2019\" and that the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell was limited to \"some cartoon drawing.\" While it is true that the media did cover the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, it was not because of his race or political beliefs, but rather because the trial was held in a state court where cameras and recording devices are allowed. The claim also implies that the media is hiding something about Ghislaine Maxwell's trial, but this is not supported by the evidence. The trial is being held in a federal court, where cameras and recording devices are not typically allowed, and the media is providing coverage through courtroom sketches and written reports. The claim is half-true because it is partially accurate in stating that the media is covering the two trials differently, but it is misleading and inaccurate in its characterization of the reasons for this difference."

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim is partially true, but it oversimplifies and exaggerates the events that occurred in Seattle's police-free protest zone, known as CHOP. While Raz Simone did give out a gun to a fellow protester, there is no evidence linking that gun to fatal shootings that occurred in and near CHOP. Additionally, there is no evidence that a paramilitary force carried out the shootings, and Simone did not \"conquer\" the area or rob locals. The claim also implies that Simone was the leader of the area, which is not supported by evidence.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Timothy Simpkins, a Black teen shooter, got 1 day in jail and $75,000 bail, while Kyle Rittenhouse, a white teen, got 2 months in jail and $2 million bail. The evidence shows that Simpkins was released from jail on October 7, 2021, after paying a $75,000 bond, which is consistent with the claim. However, the claim also states that Simpkins got 1 day in jail, which is incorrect. Simpkins was in jail for at least 1 day, as he was arrested on October 6, 2021, and released the next day. Additionally, the claim implies that Rittenhouse got 2 months in jail, which is also incorrect. Rittenhouse was released from jail on November 20, 2020, after posting a $2 million bail, which is more than 10 months after his arrest.

While it is true that the bill provides a form of parole to certain immigrants who are in the country without permission, the claim is misleading because it implies that this parole is equivalent to a pardon or early release from prison, which is not the case. In immigration law, parole refers to a process that gives people temporary permission to stay in the country for humanitarian or other reasons, and it does not necessarily imply that the individual has been convicted of a crime. Additionally, the claim is also misleading because it implies that the parole is available to people who have been convicted of crimes in the U.S., which is not the case. The bill specifically states that people convicted of crimes in the U.S. would not be eligible for immigration parole under this provision.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) cited three main factors for the increase: rising health care costs, a move by Congress last year that held the premium increase to just $3 a month because of the pandemic, and the need to raise money for a possible unprecedented surge in drug costs. Inflation was not on that list. Additionally, Medicare is largely immune from inflation because the program sets prices for hospitals and doctors.

According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition's 2021 report, 31-40% of renter households in Wisconsin are severely cost-burdened, which means they pay more than 50% of their income for housing.

The warrants for the search indicate that the agency is investigating potential crimes including intentional damage to a protected computer, wire fraud, conspiracy to cause intentional damage to a protected computer, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. There is no evidence to support the claim that Bishop was targeted because of her protests. The article's claim that the FBI is treating parents like her as domestic terrorists is also debunked.

Additionally, the bill includes funding to strengthen tax enforcement and expand audits, but the goal is to target the rich, not individuals who spend $28 a day. The claim is also misleading as it implies that spending $28 a day would trigger an audit, which is not the case.

While the bill does expand the federal government's role in child care, it does not nationalize the industry or give the federal government direct control over child care facilities. Instead, it provides funding and sets certain standards for states to follow in order to receive the funding. States will have significant autonomy in implementing the program, and parents will still have the ability to choose the child care provider that best fits their needs. The bill also includes provisions that allow for religious institutions to participate in the program, but with certain restrictions. Overall, the claim is an exaggeration and does not accurately reflect the actual provisions of the bill."

The evidence suggests that the original estimate of $100 billion in federal funding for Medicaid expansion in Texas was based on a 2013 report by Billy Hamilton Consulting, which analyzed federal funding under scenarios of minimal, moderate, and high enrollment levels. The report estimated that Texas would receive nearly $100 billion in federal funding over a decade if it expanded Medicaid. However, more recent estimates suggest that the actual amount of federal funding Texas would receive if it expanded Medicaid is likely to be significantly lower, ranging from $5 billion to $6 billion annually. Therefore, while the claim is based on a valid estimate, it is not entirely accurate, and the actual amount of federal funding Texas would receive is likely to be lower than the original estimate."

The evidence provided shows that Berenson's conclusion is based on a flawed comparison between people in a 50-year age range, without taking into account the age distribution in the population and the fact that the vaccinated population skews older. The government's analysis of the same data set, which takes into account age-standardized mortality rates and other variables, shows that the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19 is 32 times greater in unvaccinated people than in fully vaccinated individuals, and that mortality rates are consistently lower for people who have received two vaccinations compared with one or no vaccinations. The footnote on the table provided by Berenson himself explains that the higher mortality rate among vaccinated people in the 10-to-59 age group is due to the fact that the vaccinated population is older on average, which increases mortality rates.

The evidence suggests that electric vehicles use little battery power when at a standstill, and the amounts used by the car electronics and heating/cooling systems are relatively small. Additionally, even half-charged, a 62 kWh battery could yield 10 to 15 hours of heating in a car that's stationary during a traffic jam, which is sufficient to keep the occupants comfortable. Furthermore, a British consumer watchdog group tested an electric vehicle's battery performance during a simulated traffic jam and found that the car's main 77 kWh battery lost only 2% of its power after 75 minutes of using various functions, which is equivalent to 8 miles of driving range.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year\" is partially true. According to the evidence, per capita, inflation-adjusted disposable personal income has risen fairly steadily since the first quarter of 2016, and was higher in the third quarter of 2021 than in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, this trend is partly due to government payments and changes in consumer spending habits during the pandemic, rather than solely due to economic growth. The evidence suggests that the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year, but the claim oversimplifies the complex factors contributing to this increase."

The report warns against using the raw data to estimate vaccine effectiveness due to inherent biases present in the data, such as differences in risk, behavior, and testing between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. The report also notes that the high overall vaccination rate in the UK and differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations may skew the numbers. Additionally, the report highlights that the vaccines are highly effective against the delta COVID variant, with effectiveness rates ranging from 90%-99% for preventing hospitalization and mortality.

According to Reynolds' research, there are 161 examples of the Senate establishing work-arounds to the ordinary 60-vote requirement to push past a filibuster. While some experts note that not all carve-outs are equal and that some may be more significant than others, the evidence suggests that there have been at least 160 carve-outs to the filibuster over time. The claim is not entirely accurate, as some of the carve-outs may not be as sweeping or significant as others, but it is generally true that there have been many exceptions to the filibuster rule."

According to the evidence, there were 1,021 reports of deaths from Johnson & Johnson, 3,745 from Moderna, and 4,077 from Pfizer BioNTech, which is fewer than half of the claimed numbers. Additionally, the evidence states that VAERS is an underreporting system and that correlation does not imply causation, and that the reports are not verified. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

The evidence provided shows that while there is a risk of myocarditis after vaccination, it is rare and generally mild, and the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. Additionally, hospitalizations due to COVID-19 infection remain low in teens, and the risk of illness or death due to the virus is greater than the risk from myocarditis. Public health experts and the CDC have consistently stated that the vaccine is safe and effective for teens, and that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks. The claim made by Dr. McCullough is not supported by the evidence and is likely exaggerated or misleading."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that the COVID-19 vaccine is the \"deadliest vaccine ever made\" is FALSE. The evidence provided shows that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made this claim, but it is based on flawed data and misinterpretation of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data. The VAERS system is an open-access system that allows anyone to report any health effects after a vaccination, including unrelated events, and the reports are not verified before being entered. The system is designed to generate hypotheses, not provide conclusive evidence of vaccine-related adverse effects. The evidence also shows that the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to over 459 million people in the United States, with only 0.0022% of reports of death, and health officials have not detected any unusual or unexpected patterns of deaths following immunization. Additionally, experts have emphasized that reports of adverse events, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a COVID-19 vaccine caused a health problem. Therefore, the claim that the COVID-19 vaccine is the \"deadliest vaccine ever made\" is FALSE."

The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's state infectious-disease agency, states that the risk of people becoming PCR-positive despite vaccination and transmitting the virus is significantly reduced. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that vaccines are critical to controlling the pandemic, as they prevent serious illness and death, and that breakthrough infections were always expected. The evidence also shows that the vaccines' waning efficacy over time is addressed by booster shots, which are recommended by the CDC. Overall, the evidence suggests that the vaccines do not increase transmission, but rather reduce it, making the claim FALSE."

However, the claim implies that these individuals were abandoned by the Biden administration, which is not entirely accurate. According to the evidence, not all of these individuals wanted to leave Afghanistan, and some had dual citizenship. The State Department's initial estimate of 15,000 citizens was based on the known number of Americans in the country, and the number of 6,000 was later reported as the number of Americans who wanted to leave.

The bill also includes $43.8 billion in funding to give private health insurance to people who would have been covered under Medicaid expansion, which would presumably reduce the need for federal spending on charity care.

The evidence suggests that mask mandates may have a negative impact on children's ability to recognize and express emotions, which is important for learning and development. The article cited in the letter to Dr. Bernadine Futrell notes that covering the lower half of the face reduces the ability to communicate, interpret, and mimic the expressions of those with whom we interact, which can lead to reduced emotional mimicry, contagion, and emotionality. However, the evidence also suggests that the impact of mask mandates on learning loss is not clear-cut and may depend on various factors, such as the age of the child and the effectiveness of targeted interventions. Additionally, the CDC's Science brief notes that there is limited available data on the impact of masking on emotional or language development in children, and that some studies have found that children can recognize familiar words and wear masks effectively with targeted interventions.

The evidence only mentions that there were 87 motor vehicle accident deaths in 2021 throughout the county, but it does not provide a specific number of stolen cars.

However, the claim that corporations are \"overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference\" is partially misleading. While it is true that companies have been able to keep profit margins high by cutting costs and passing higher costs along to consumers, the prices of gas, groceries, and medicine have also increased due to factors such as demand and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, some economists argue that the high profit margins are not necessarily a result of companies overcharging consumers, but rather a response to the pandemic and government policies.

The evidence suggests that electric vehicles would not have been more prone to failure in general, but rather would have required more careful planning and management to ensure they had sufficient range to complete their journey. Additionally, the claim ignores the fact that electric vehicles would not have been idling, as they would have been stationary, and would not have been using as much power as gas-powered vehicles.

Omicron, on the other hand, has a basic reproduction number of 1.5-2 times that of the delta variant, which is around 5-7.

Instead, it sets a new standard for what constitutes an acceptable ID and provides workarounds for voters who lack IDs. Additionally, the bill prohibits states from requiring voters to submit IDs to obtain or cast absentee ballots, but does not eliminate the requirement for in-person voting. The claim is also based on a misinterpretation of the HEROES Act, which did propose a provision that allowed voters to meet a state's voter ID requirement by signing a sworn written statement attesting to their identity, but this was not a blanket ban on voter ID requirements.

    "VERDICT: TRUE\nREASON: The claim is supported by multiple sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Texas Department of State Health Services. The CDC data specifically states that unvaccinated people have 20 times the risk of dying from COVID-19 compared to fully vaccinated individuals, and 17 times the risk of being hospitalized due to COVID-19. The Texas data also confirms that unvaccinated individuals are 20 times more likely to suffer a COVID-19-associated death and 13 times more likely to test positive than fully vaccinated individuals. The claim is not exaggerated or misleading, and the evidence provided is credible and reliable."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"half of the bills that were successfully filibustered in the Senate were civil rights legislation\" from 1917 to 1994. While the evidence suggests that a significant number of civil rights bills were indeed filibustered during this period, the exact proportion is disputed among scholars. Sarah Binder's analysis, which is cited by the congresswoman, found that exactly half of the 30 measures identified between 1917 and 1994 addressed civil rights, but other scholars have reached different conclusions. Additionally, the definition of a filibuster and its success are matters of interpretation, which can affect the accuracy of the count. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is not entirely accurate due to the uncertainty and disagreement among scholars."

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, did say that over 75% of deaths among vaccinated individuals involved people with at least four comorbidities. However, the claim implies that this is true for all COVID-19 deaths, which is not the case. The study mentioned in the evidence only looked at vaccinated individuals, and the statistic does not apply to the overall population of people who have died from COVID-19. The claim is being misleadingly presented to make it seem like the CDC director is downplaying the severity of COVID-19, when in fact, she is highlighting the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe illness and death among people who are already at risk due to comorbidities."

Additionally, the judges' political affiliations are listed, and the panel consisted of two Republicans and one Democrat, who ruled unanimously.

However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that all Indian citizens are automatically enrolled to vote and that their names are always included on electoral lists. In reality, Indian citizens must enroll as new voters and their names must appear on electoral lists, and there are reports of citizens, mostly minorities and women, not being able to get their names added to electoral lists or being removed from the lists, which means they cannot vote.

Patrick Lucey, who served from 1971 to 1977, issued at least 392 pardons, which is more than Evers' total of 416 pardons.

The claim is also based on the unverified findings of Dr. Shankara Chetty, who has been promoting alternative treatments for COVID-19. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology defines mast cell degranulation as a response to an allergic reaction, not a cause of pneumonia.

The memo also considers non-white race or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity as a risk factor, but this is not a requirement for treatment.

However, it also shows that rising wages erased a significant portion of the inflation bump, with average hourly earnings for private employees rising by 4.7% between December 2020 and December 2021.

However, it's important to note that the study's equivalent scores do not evaluate how well students are learning, and experts stress that what Virginia considers proficient may not be at the same level as other states. Additionally, Virginia's eighth-grade math standards were not measured, and the state's students perform well on national exams in both math and reading.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true, but it is also misleading. The CDC study found that people with natural immunity from a previous COVID-19 infection were better protected against the delta variant than vaccinated people who had never been infected. However, the study had several limitations, including a limited sample size, and did not account for the severity of previous infections or deaths from the virus. Additionally, the study was conducted before the spread of the omicron variant, and the CDC has emphasized that vaccination is the safest form of protection against COVID-19, providing additional protection for people who have already been infected. The claim also ignores the fact that a previous COVID-19 infection does not guarantee that a person will not need medical care if they get the virus again. Overall, while the study suggests that natural immunity may provide some protection, it is not superior to vaccinated immunity alone, and vaccination is still the best way to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death."

While the bill does include significant expansions of social safety-net programs, including affordable health care, housing, and home health care, it is difficult to determine whether it is the largest expansion in 60 years due to the lack of a clear definition of welfare and the complexity of the bill's provisions. Additionally, the bill also includes provisions that benefit people with higher incomes, making it difficult to categorize the entire bill as solely a welfare program.

State and local officials would still have significant discretion in many aspects of election administration, such as processing mail ballot requests, operating polling places, and setting up and testing equipment.

Firstly, the claim that the overall COVID-19 death count is inflated by people who died \"with\" rather than \"from\" the virus has been debunked. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the underlying cause of death as \"the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person's death,\" and in 92% of death certificates that mention the virus, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. Secondly, the claim that 75% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in people with four or more comorbidities is also false. This statistic was taken out of context from a statement by CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who was referring to a study of COVID-19 deaths in vaccinated people, not all COVID-19 deaths. Finally, the claim that nursing home residents are an already-vulnerable population that should be excluded from the overall count is not supported by scientific evidence, as studies have shown that their risk of dying increased during the pandemic.

However, not all armed robberies would be downgraded to misdemeanors, only those that meet this specific criteria. Additionally, the claim that the DA is stopping prosecuting resisting arrest is also partially true, as Bragg's memo states that resisting arrest would not be prosecuted unless accompanied by another charge not included on the list of offenses the office was generally declining to prosecute.

A closer examination of the evidence shows that Fauci's guidance was nuanced and context-dependent, and that he was responding to the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic. The ad's editing and omission of key words and caveats create a false narrative that Fauci was inconsistent and contradictory in his advice.

The claim about the German doctor, Andreas Noack, being murdered after reporting the presence of graphene oxide in vaccines is also false. The claim about the full list of ingredients being secret because of the emergency use authorization is also false, as the list of ingredients is publicly available on the CDC website. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that President Joe Biden gave Congress an exemption from the vaccine mandate, but the evidence suggests that this is not accurate. According to the evidence, members of Congress are not exempt from the vaccine mandate because they work directly for the people, not for President Biden, and he therefore has no power to give them orders. However, the evidence also suggests that the vaccine mandate for federal workers and contractors is currently blocked by court orders, which means that the claim is not entirely false. Therefore, the verdict is HALF-TRUE."

According to the evidence, New York state parks had a record-high attendance in 2021, breaking the record set in 2020. However, the increase in attendance during the pandemic was smaller compared to the increases prior to the pandemic. The attendance figures show that the annual increases during the pandemic were smaller than the increases prior to the pandemic, with a growth of around 427,000 visitors in 2021 compared to 2020, whereas the growth was over 2.9 million visitors between 2018 and 2019, and over 2.6 million visitors between 2017 and 2018.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Total deaths from COVID MUCH LOWER than reported\" is partially true. The evidence suggests that the number of deaths attributed solely to COVID-19 might be lower than the overall number of deaths involving COVID-19. According to the Office for National Statistics, in England and Wales, there were 17,371 deaths where COVID-19 was the sole cause of death, while there were 131,641 deaths overall where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that the reported death toll is inflated, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the reported death toll is accurate, and the difference between the two numbers is due to the fact that COVID-19 is often mentioned as a contributing factor to death, even if it was not the sole cause. Additionally, the claim is made by a single individual, John Campbell, who is not a credible source, and the claim is not supported by any credible scientific evidence.

The FDA's decision was also supported by the drugmakers themselves, who acknowledged that their treatments were not effective against omicron.

However, the claim exaggerates the situation by stating that 50,000-100,000 Americans are infected by Delta every day, which is not supported by the evidence. Additionally, the claim implies that Biden is directly responsible for the removal of the treatments, which is not accurate. The FDA made the decision based on the effectiveness of the treatments against the omicron variant.

The academic paper analyzed by Bowman's office found that the number of Black and Latino students admitted through affirmative action was higher than the number of white legacy students admitted, but only when considering the numbers individually. The claim also does not account for the fact that legacy admissions are not exclusive to white students, and that Black and Latinx students can also benefit from legacy admissions.

For example, President Reagan's nomination of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was motivated in part by his desire to appoint the first woman to the Court, and President Trump's nomination of Justice Amy Coney Barrett was motivated in part by his desire to appoint a woman to the Court. Additionally, the evidence shows that race and gender have played a role in other Supreme Court nominations throughout history.

In reality, ballot harvesting is a legal practice in many states, including Wisconsin, where voters can designate someone to return their absentee ballot for them. The claim also fails to acknowledge that the Wisconsin Elections Commission has provided guidance to clerks stating that both drop boxes and delivery of ballots by other individuals are permitted.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Pfizer is \"literally using the force of government and the culture of fear to jab children under 5 \u2014 with zero basis in science \u2014 to make billions of dollars.\" While it is true that Pfizer is seeking authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine for children under 5, the claim is exaggerated and misleading. The evidence suggests that Pfizer's effort is based on scientific data and rigorous testing, and the company is not using the government or fear to push the vaccine. Additionally, the claim implies that Pfizer is motivated by profit, which is not supported by the evidence. While Pfizer does stand to make money from the vaccine, the company's primary goal is to provide a safe and effective vaccine to protect public health. The claim is also misleading in its characterization of the vaccine's effectiveness, as the evidence suggests that the vaccine is safe and effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization in children under 5. Overall, the claim is HALF-TRUE because it is based on some factual information, but it is exaggerated and misleading in its characterization of Pfizer's motivations and the vaccine's effectiveness."

The evidence suggests that the books mentioned in the claim have not been removed from libraries statewide, and that the removal of books is typically done on a case-by-case basis through a transparent process.

Additionally, the bill's purpose is to allow parents to watch a livestream of their child's class, not to spy on teachers and children.

Additionally, research from behavioral economics and psychology has found that intense emotions like anger and sadness can cause people to take actions they later regret, and inserting a short delay in the gun-buying process can reduce gun violence (Behavioral Scientist article, 2018). However, the evidence also suggests that waiting periods may not be effective in all situations, such as when guns are bought \"off the black market\" or when a gun is needed for self-defense.

However, the evidence also shows that the state has obligated or expended nearly $750 million of the ARPA funds, which is not included in the initial $541 million spent. Additionally, the state has allocated all $2 billion in CARES Act funding, with only about 1% left to be spent. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is not entirely accurate.

However, the actual available generation capacity is lower due to the limitations of wind and solar power, which do not operate at 100% capacity all the time.

This form is issued for civil violations, such as entering the country without proper documentation or overstaying a visa, and is often the only form of identification available to individuals released by ICE.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that the CDC was \"normalizing blood clots\" by tweeting about the health condition before the Super Bowl is partially true. The CDC did tweet about blood clots before the Super Bowl, but it was not an isolated incident. The CDC had previously tweeted about blood clots in the past, including in 2015 and 2016, and had also warned about the dangers of blood clots during other big sporting events. The tweet was not specifically targeting the Super Bowl or COVID-19 vaccination, but rather was part of the CDC's ongoing efforts to educate the public about the risks of blood clots. The claim that the CDC was \"normalizing blood clots\" is an exaggeration and is likely intended to create a false narrative about the CDC's intentions."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true because Texas' public pension systems do invest in Chinese companies, which are funded in part with tax dollars. However, the claim is also partially false because the governor, Greg Abbott, does not directly invest tax money in Chinese companies. The investment decisions are made by the pension systems' boards and managers, and the governor's role is limited to oversight and appointing board members. The claim is an exaggeration and misleads the public by implying that the governor is directly responsible for the investments."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"the global economies shutting down all at once, reopening all at once\" caused inflation, which is partially supported by the evidence. Patrick Gaspard, a panelist, made this claim, and the evidence shows that the global economies did shut down and reopen rapidly, which contributed to the current high inflation rate. However, the claim also states that the U.S. economy is recovering at a far faster pace than any other country in the OECD, which is partially supported by the evidence. The OECD report and other calculations show that the U.S. economy has indeed grown rapidly, but not all experts agree that this is the sole cause of inflation. The evidence suggests that there are other factors at play, such as the pandemic, and that the relationship between rapid growth and high inflation is not perfect. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The Emergencies Act does give the federal government, police, and banks specific powers, including the ability to freeze personal and corporate accounts without a court order. However, the claim is exaggerated as it implies that the Act is tantamount to martial law, which typically involves the suspension of civil rights and the rule by military authorities. Trudeau explicitly stated that he will not call in the military and that the Act does not suspend fundamental rights or override the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Act is being used to address a public order emergency caused by blockades and occupations, not to impose martial law.

The data was collected in 2016 and early 2017, before Trump took office. However, the claim that the Clinton campaign spied on the president is an exaggeration, as the data was not collected after Trump took office, and the purpose of the data collection was to gather information about potential links between the Trump Organization and Russia, not to spy on Trump himself.

However, the claim is misleading because it implies that the stock sales were made in response to bad news, which is not supported by the evidence. The sales were actually part of a pre-planned trading strategy, and the timing of the sales was not related to any specific news or event. Additionally, the claim exaggerates the amount of stock sold, as Bancel sold $6.1 million worth of stock in February, not $400 million.

The investigation was part of the Clinton campaign's efforts to understand the Russian interference in the 2016 election. Additionally, the court filing by Durham does not support the claim of spying, but rather alleges that Sussmann made a false statement to the FBI about the nature of his meeting with the FBI.

Additionally, the report notes that the vetting process was done with the information available at the time, and the administration did not have access to biometric and biographical data from foreign allies until late 2021.

The evidence suggests that drug seizures have been increasing since at least 2016, and the trend predates Biden's presidency. Additionally, experts argue that seizures are a problematic way to measure the effectiveness of border protection, as traffickers constantly adapt their tactics to evade detection.

However, the claim is also misleading because it only focuses on the first year in office, which is cherry-picked to show a positive trend. The evidence also shows that homicides fluctuated under Irvin's tenure, and the claim ignores the increase in homicides in his second year in office.

The \"Ghost of Kyiv\" is a nickname given to a Ukrainian pilot who allegedly shot down six Russian planes in one day, but his real name is not confirmed.

The Associated Press investigation found fewer than 475 voter fraud cases in six battleground states, which represents 0.15% of Biden's victory margin. Most of the cases involved lone actors or administrative errors, and there is no evidence of \"rigging\" or collusion.

While it is true that the pipeline would have had the capacity to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day, the evidence suggests that the US was already importing over 800,000 barrels per day from Russia in May 2021, and this figure decreased to 595,000 by October 2021. Therefore, the claim is only half-true because it is based on a static figure of 830,000 barrels per day, without considering the actual import figures from Russia, which were already above that amount. Additionally, the pipeline would have taken years to construct and faced legal challenges, making it uncertain whether it would have actually offset Russian imports."

The evidence suggests that when considering the annual percentage increase, 2021's 4.4% increase was not the highest in history, and the economy is still below its pre-pandemic peak.

The sanctions did have carve-outs for certain financial transactions, including some related to the energy industry.

The claim that masks are a symbol of paranoia is also partially true, as some people may view mask-wearing as an overreaction to the pandemic.

Additionally, the Republican Party's platform on arming Ukraine has been inconsistent, with the 2016 platform supporting providing Ukraine with weapons and the 2020 platform not adopting a new platform, but rather reiterating support for Trump and his administration.

Additionally, the Kremlin's transcripts of Putin's conversations reveal no mention of child trafficking, and the Real Raw News article that made the claim is known for fabricating sources, stories, headlines, and bylines.

The correct figure is 60%, which is based on a 1991 report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. However, this figure is over 30 years old, and more recent data is limited. A 2000 study found a net gain of 17,619 acres of wetlands in five geographic zones in New York state from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but this increase accounted for less than 1% of the state's existing wetlands acreage.

However, this was not a direct report from CNN, but rather a report from the companies themselves, which was broadcasted by CNN and other news outlets. Additionally, Walensky was not working for the CDC at the time, so she would have received this information through the same channels as the general public.

The current high price of oil is due to a combination of factors, including the global pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the global market's response to these events. The claim also implies that the Biden administration is solely responsible for the high oil prices, which is not supported by the evidence. Energy experts state that the oil industry is making a profit and choosing not to invest in new production, and that the Biden administration does not have the legal tools to force companies to produce more oil.

The pipeline would not have been able to solve the demand needs of the US and would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges. Additionally, the ad's claim that the cancellation increased dependence on Russian oil is not supported by the S&P Global Report, which actually states that Russia filled the gap left by US oil sanctions on Venezuela.

The evidence shows that O'Rourke was actually referring to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's order to investigate parents for child abuse for providing gender-affirming care for transgender children, not his own plan.

However, the evidence shows that Harris was actually asked about gasoline prices and inflation in a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, not Polish President Andrzej Duda. Harris did pause before responding, but it was not because she was trying to defer to President Duda, but rather because she was taken aback by the question. The claim is half-true because it is partially accurate in stating that Harris was asked about gasoline prices, but it is inaccurate in stating that she was asked by President Duda and that she tried to defer to him."

The presence of apes does raise questions about the concept of evolution, as it can be confusing to understand how humans and apes evolved from a common ancestor. However, the evidence provided suggests that humans and apes did evolve from ancient apes, and that the apes alive today are not the same kinds of apes that were alive millions of years ago. The concept of evolution is not called into question by the presence of apes, but rather, it is a natural part of the evolutionary process."

The evidence suggests that the rise in gas prices was a complex phenomenon driven by multiple factors, including the economic recovery from the pandemic, low investment in production during the pandemic, and the refusal of OPEC and its allies to increase production. While Putin's actions did contribute to the price increase, they were not the sole cause. The claim also ignores the fact that the majority of the rise in gas prices occurred before the troop buildup became a major story in November 2021. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

However, the claim is also misleading because it cherry-picks data and ignores other factors that affect gas prices, such as inflation, labor costs, and local market conditions. Additionally, the comparison between 2008 and 2022 is not entirely accurate, as there are unique circumstances in each year that affect the price of oil and gas.

This matches the claim's figure of 80 cents for every dollar. However, the evidence also notes that this figure is not an apples-to-apples comparison of men and women performing the same work, and that the pay gap is influenced by various factors such as women's greater responsibility for child-rearing, their choice of occupations, and their work history.

In contrast, the US has a more robust system of free speech, with independent news organizations, a diverse range of information, and no government coercion to control the media. While there may be some similarities between the two countries, such as the presence of state-owned media outlets, the overall environment for free speech in the US is much more permissive and less restrictive than in Russia.

The bulk of such subsidies can only be overturned by congressional action, not unilaterally by Biden.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"The price of insulin has been jacked up by Big Drug Corporations\" is partially true. While it is true that the price of insulin has increased significantly over the years, the evidence suggests that the situation is more complex and multifaceted. The American Action Forum report shows that the average list price of insulin increased 11% annually from 2001 to 2018, but the Health Care Cost Institute report reveals that the average monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin in 2019 was $82, with the highest spending category having a median monthly out-of-pocket spending of $315. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also notes that Americans pay 10 times what people in other developed countries pay. However, the evidence also suggests that there are other factors involved in pricing and that the savings from rebates are not always passed through to patients. The Senate Finance Committee report notes that pharmaceutical manufacturers are retaining more revenue from insulin than in the 2000s, but it does not solely blame the drug companies for the high prices. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it oversimplifies the complex issue of insulin pricing and does not provide a complete understanding of the factors involved."

Additionally, the article in question was about McCormick's appointment to a Commerce Department post, not about the layoffs or offshoring.

While the Biden administration has implemented policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel production and use, such as suspending drilling and mining on Bureau of Land Management property and canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, these policies are not the sole cause of high gas prices. The evidence suggests that the main factors contributing to high gas prices are the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic and disruptions to global supply and demand. The article cites a report from the New York Times stating that gas prices have risen largely in response to the pandemic and the decrease in supply and increase in demand. Additionally, the article notes that gas prices were already rising before the Biden administration took office, and that the Keystone XL pipeline's cancellation would have had a minimal impact on global oil production.

The data from the Energy Information Administration shows an increasing trend in gas prices since April 2020, nine months before Biden took office. Additionally, the sharpest increases at the pump have come since the start of the war in Ukraine, which is not directly related to the Keystone XL pipeline.

While it is true that Judge Jackson handed down sentences below the guidelines and below what prosecutors were requesting in some cases, it is also important to note that this is not a consistent pattern and that judges and prosecutors often give lesser sentences than what the government wants. Additionally, the claim does not take into account the distinction between production and possession of child pornography, which is an important factor in determining sentence length. Furthermore, the claim does not provide context about the severity of the crimes and the circumstances of the cases, which can also impact sentence length.

The evidence shows that she wrote an article in 1996 questioning the constitutionality of sex offender registries, arguing that they could be punitive rather than preventative. While she did not explicitly state that she thinks perverts should not register, her argument was focused on the intent behind the registries, suggesting that they could be unconstitutional if their sole purpose is to punish offenders.

Corrections custody should be released due to the pandemic, the context of the statement is crucial. Jackson's statement was part of a ruling in a specific case, where she was considering the release of a defendant who was seeking to be released from the D.C. jail to home confinement due to the pandemic. She did not advocate for releasing all defendants without considering individual circumstances. Additionally, Blackburn's statement cherry-picks part of Jackson's ruling, omitting the fact that Jackson also wrote about the constraints on judicial authority and the need to assess an inmate's flight risk and dangerousness before releasing them.

The evidence suggests that the energy payback time for wind turbines is relatively short, ranging from less than one year to six years, depending on the study. This means that the initial greenhouse gas emissions from building and decommissioning wind turbines are spread out over the turbine's lifespan, resulting in a lower carbon footprint per kilowatt hour. However, the claim implies that the overall return is negative, which is not supported by the evidence.

However, when considering the absolute numbers, the United States is indeed the leader in terms of the total metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions reduced. However, when looking at the relative change in emissions, many economic peers, such as the UK, Italy, France, and Germany, have achieved steeper declines. Additionally, the claim does not account for emissions per capita, which would show that the United States still has higher emissions per capita compared to countries like China and India.

While it is true that some stores may not have certain types of bread or may experience temporary shortages due to labor shortages or other factors, it is not accurate to say that all stores do not have bread. The evidence suggests that most stores are stocked with bread, and any shortages are typically limited to specific products or brands. Additionally, the evidence shows that the supply of baked goods has been improving over time. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also exaggerated and misleading."

While it is true that some cities in Texas and Florida saw a higher increase in murders, the overall increase in violent crime in these states was not significantly higher than in NYS. According to the evidence, the increase in murders in NYS was higher than in Texas and Florida when looking at the statewide data, and the increase in aggravated assaults was lower in NYS compared to the other two states.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Senate Republicans' plan\" would \"end Social Security\" and \"end Medicare\" is partially true, but also partially misleading. The plan proposed by Sen. Rick Scott does not directly call for ending these programs, but rather suggests that all federal legislation, including those creating Social Security and Medicare, would sunset within five years unless explicitly renewed by Congress. This means that the fate of these programs would be left to the whims of Congress, which could potentially lead to their termination. However, it is important to note that the plan is not a unified proposal from all Senate Republicans, and some leading Republicans, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have rejected parts of it. Additionally, the plan's language is open to interpretation, and it is unclear whether Congress would actually allow these programs to expire. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also partially misleading and oversimplifies the complexity of the issue."

While there is a possibility that a child could get sick from a visit to the doctor, experts in the field of pediatrics and medicine widely tout well-child visits as key for child health and parent information. The evidence also highlights the importance of infection control precautions in healthcare settings, which minimize the risk of transmission of illnesses. The claim is also contradicted by multiple studies, including the University of Iowa study mentioned in the article, which found no increased risk of infection from well-child visits.

Furthermore, the claim does not account for the fact that veterans are seen by a medical professional in approximately 40 days on average in 2021, and wait times vary depending on the service and location.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the Democrat's plan would tax billionaires to lower the deficit by $1 trillion and fund clean energy independence, which is partially true. According to the evidence, the Biden administration's proposed budget would impose a tax on households worth more than $100 million, which would impact about 20,000 households, or less than 0.01% of the country's population. This tax would generate $360 billion in revenue over the next decade, not $1 trillion. Additionally, the claim mentions funding clean energy initiatives, which is also true, as the budget sets aside $45 billion for climate change efforts. However, the claim is exaggerated and lacks important context about both policies, as the evidence suggests. The Republican plan, on the other hand, is not accurately described in the claim, as it appears to be a reference to an 11-point proposal by Sen.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"The price of insulin increases as waistlines increase\" is partially true. While it is true that the number of diabetes cases has increased over the years, and obesity is a risk factor for developing Type 2 diabetes, the evidence suggests that the increase in insulin prices is not directly related to the increase in waistlines. The experts consulted in the article agree that the list price of insulin has increased over the past decade, but this is due to various factors such as the pharmaceutical industry's pricing strategy, the role of pharmacy benefit managers, and the lack of competition in the market. The article also highlights that production costs are unlikely to change significantly with increased demand, and that the manufacturers and other stakeholders benefit from higher list prices, except for the consumers who have to purchase it to survive. Therefore, while there is a correlation between the increase in diabetes cases and the increase in insulin prices, the claim that the price of insulin increases as waistlines increase is only partially true."

While Johnson did vote for the Better Care Reconciliation Act amendment that would have allowed insurance companies to offer plans that could deny coverage to sick people, it's important to note that this amendment was part of a larger bill that aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and Johnson's office has committed to protecting people with pre-existing conditions. Additionally, the amendment would have required insurance companies to offer at least one comprehensive plan that followed the Affordable Care Act's rules, which would have still provided coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

In fact, he has expressed uncertainty about how long the protection lasts and has spoken encouragingly about it on several occasions. However, the claim is also partially true because Fauci's 2004 statement, taken out of context, may be misinterpreted as downplaying the importance of natural immunity. The evidence suggests that Fauci's statement was made in the context of influenza, not COVID-19, and was influenced by the limited understanding of immunity against respiratory viruses at the time. Additionally, Fauci's current stance on natural immunity is more nuanced, acknowledging its protective benefits while also emphasizing the importance of vaccination.

The Democratic Party's claim is misleading because it compares the House budget to the proposed budget by former Governor Northam, which included a $2.4 billion increase in education spending, rather than comparing it to the current budget.

However, the claim that Oz said \"Americans should have less access to guns\" is partially false. While Oz did write that \"let's add in more access to health care; less access to guns that aren't designed for hunting\" in a 2013 column, he did not specify how to achieve \"less access\" to guns. Additionally, Oz has since distanced himself from some of his previous statements on gun control and has taken a more conservative stance on the issue.

However, the evidence shows that the fuel tax in Australia is not 48%, but rather 22.1 cents per liter, which is a much lower rate. Additionally, the claim does not take into account the GST, which is a 10% tax on gas purchases. The total taxes paid on a $67 gas purchase would be around 19%, not 48%. The claim also lacks context about income tax rates, which vary depending on the country and individual circumstances. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also misleading and exaggerated."

The evidence shows that Soros' Open Society Foundations did make grants to various organizations and initiatives related to the Black Lives Matter movement, but not directly to the organization itself. The $33 million figure is also not a direct injection of funds, but rather a total of grants made over a period of time. Additionally, the grants were not exclusively for the Black Lives Matter movement, but rather for a broader range of social justice initiatives.

While it is true that consuming large amounts of sugar can increase the risk of certain cancers, the evidence does not support the claim that sugar is a direct cause of cancer. The evidence suggests that the relationship between sugar and cancer is more complex, and that other factors, such as weight gain and excess body fat, may play a larger role in the development of certain cancers. Additionally, the claim that avoiding sugar is the best way to prevent cancer is also an oversimplification, as a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods and nutrients is likely to be more effective in reducing the risk of cancer."

While it is true that the US government is distributing smartphones to some immigrants who have been detained after entering the country illegally, the claim is misleading because it implies that the phones are being given away as a gift or for personal use. In reality, the phones are being issued as part of ICE's Alternative to Detention program to track immigrants who have been released from detention and are awaiting a deportation hearing. The phones are pre-loaded with an application called SmartLINK that requires users to check in with immigration officials and do not have the capability to make personal phone calls, check social media, or browse the internet. The claim is also misleading because it does not provide context about the limited scope of the program and the fact that not all immigrants detained by ICE receive a government-issued device."

This aligns with his earlier statements in the 1990s, where he supported a woman's right to choose and voted against measures that would have restricted access to abortion. While he has also described himself as \"pro-life\" at times, this is a nuanced position that does not necessarily contradict his support for a woman's right to choose.

The document was later released, and the numbers were made public. While Pfizer did hire more employees to process adverse event reports, this was to meet the demands of processing an influx of unvetted reports, not to hide the information.

The CPI increased in February 2021, March 2021, April 2021, May 2021, June 2021, July 2021, August 2021, and September 2021, but not in January 2021. Additionally, the claim that \"just hit another 40-year high\" is also partially true, as the inflation rate did reach its highest point in 40 years in March 2022, sitting at about 8.5%.

Additionally, his campaign rhetoric and policy positions are not friendly to China, and he has criticized the Biden administration on issues such as inflation, border policy, and foreign policy. The only potential connection to China mentioned in the evidence is his past work with a hedge fund that managed money for Chinese investors, but this is not evidence of being \"pro-China.\" The claim that McCormick is \"pro-China\" is likely a mischaracterization and a political attack by his opponent, Mehmet Oz."

In fact, the EPA and many car manufacturers have approved the use of E15 fuel in their vehicles, and studies have shown no evidence of engine durability or maintenance issues. However, it is also true that E15 fuel may not be suitable for all vehicles, such as those with heavy-duty engines or certain non-road vehicles.

The claim implies that the current justice reform policies are responsible for James being able to commit the attack, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that James' prior arrests were largely unrelated to the current justice reform efforts and that he had no felony convictions that would have prevented him from buying the gun he allegedly used in the attack.

However, the claim is also misleading because it oversimplifies the complex factors driving inflation, which include global supply chain disruptions, the war in Ukraine, and pre-existing economic conditions.

    "VERDICT: TRUE\nREASON: The evidence provided supports the claim that the state crime lab under Attorney General Josh Kaul is testing significantly less items than former AG Brad Schimel and is still taking longer to test many categories of key items in comparison to Schimel, including DNA. The evidence shows that in 2021, the crime lab took 9,297 cases, a 30% drop from 12,680 cases in 2018 under Schimel. Additionally, the 2021 annual report from Kaul's Department of Justice shows that in the 10 categories analyzed, turnaround took more time in six of them under Kaul than under Schimel, including DNA analysis and DNA databank. The report also shows that in the DNA analysis category, the lab is handling fewer cases and taking longer with them, with a median turnaround time of 115 days in 2021 compared to 50 days in 2018. Similarly, in the DNA databank category, the median turnaround time was 41 days in 2021 compared to 24 days in 2018. The evidence also shows that in other categories, such as AFIS, controlled substances, firearms, toxicology, and forensic imaging, the lab is handling fewer cases and taking longer to complete them. While the evidence does show that Kaul did have a better showing in some areas, such as latent prints, trace evidence, and crime scene responses, the overall trend is that the crime lab under Kaul is testing fewer items and taking longer to test many categories of key items compared to Schimel. Therefore, the claim is TRUE."

Additionally, his duties as a practice professor did not conform to the full range of activities typically associated with a full professor, such as teaching semester-long classes, conducting independent research, and handling administrative responsibilities.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that Canada's new law allows the government to take children away if parents don't accept their \"gender identity.\" However, the evidence provided shows that the 2017 Child, Youth and Family Services Act aimed to strengthen and modernize child welfare services, including making them more inclusive and culturally relevant. The law added \"gender identity\" and \"gender expression\" to the list of factors considered by child protection workers, but this does not mean that children can be taken away solely because of a parent's refusal to accept their gender identity. In fact, the Ontario Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services explicitly stated that child protection workers cannot remove children from their families solely on this basis. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresentation of the actual changes made to the law."

However, the evidence retrieved shows that the settlement agreement was not a consent decree, but rather a compromise settlement agreement and release. The agreement did not mention voter ID law, and Georgia law still requires photo identification when voting in person or absentee. Additionally, the agreement did not open up the door to fraudulent ballots, and the signature match ballot rejection rate actually increased slightly from 2018 to 2020. The presidential election results in Georgia were counted three times, and each showed Biden won, with no evidence of systematic voter fraud found. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

The evidence from the Voice of America article and the testimony of Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior policy counsel for the American Immigration Council, supports this claim. According to Reichlin-Melnick, the lack of collateral consequences for individuals expelled under Title 42, such as no opportunity to appeal immigration decisions or challenge a decision to expel someone from the U.S., has incentivized many migrants to try again, leading to an increase in repeated border crossings. This evidence suggests that Title 42 has indeed contributed to the border crisis."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"mRNA Vaccines Show No Mortality Benefit - Danish Study\" is partially true. The study found that the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna did not show a significant reduction in overall mortality, as 61 out of 74,193 participants died, with 31 receiving the vaccine and 30 receiving a placebo. However, the study also found that the adenovirus-vector vaccines showed a significant reduction in overall mortality, with 46 deaths out of 122,164 participants. Additionally, the study found that the mRNA vaccines did not show a significant reduction in COVID-19 mortality, with only two out of 31 deaths in the mRNA-vaccinated group being due to COVID-19. Therefore, while the claim is partially true in the sense that the mRNA vaccines did not show a significant reduction in overall mortality, it is also misleading because it does not provide the full context of the study's findings and does not specify that the results are about non-COVID-19 related deaths."

Additionally, the experts cited in the evidence do not provide any evidence to support the claim that Black students are \"overwhelmingly\" responsible for hate crimes on college campuses.

The claim also relies on outdated and potentially misleading data, and the concept of \"living paycheck to paycheck\" is not well-defined. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that many Americans making high salaries may also be living paycheck to paycheck due to irresponsible financial management or high expenses. The evidence suggests that the actual percentage of Americans living paycheck to paycheck is likely lower than 76%, and the claim is an exaggeration."

However, it does not explicitly state that small businesses did not benefit at all. In fact, the evidence mentions that some small businesses may have benefited from the tax break, but the majority of the benefits went to the wealthy owners of large companies. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is accurate that the tax break benefited the wealthiest individuals, but it is not entirely accurate that it did not benefit small businesses at all."

According to the evidence, the Brookings Institution states that 56% of the outstanding student debt is owed by households that hold graduate degrees. However, this does not necessarily mean that 60% of the debt was spent on graduate school. As Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert, points out, many households have undergraduate debt even though someone in the household also has a graduate degree, and assuming that all student loans in a household are graduate school debt significantly overstates the amount of graduate school debt. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office found that in 2017, about 60% of outstanding student loan debt was spent during undergraduate school, while the remaining 40% was spent during graduate school. Therefore, while the claim is close to the truth, it is not entirely accurate."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Republican politicians are pushing a plan that could raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites and sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years.

Rick Scott, R-Florida, does contain provisions that could raise taxes on a significant number of people, including 32% of Wisconsinites, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Additionally, the plan does propose sunsetting all federal legislation in five years, which could potentially affect Social Security and Medicare. However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that Republicans are uniformly supporting this plan, which is not the case. Sen. Scott himself has stated that it is not the Republican plan and that he is presenting his own approach.

The evidence shows that multiple Republican-controlled states have passed laws that impose prison sentences on doctors who perform or attempt to perform abortions, which contradicts the claim.

This methodology is disputed by experts, and other organizations have produced different results using different criteria.

However, the claim that \"the vast majority\" do not show up is an exaggeration, as the data shows that a majority of immigrants do show up for their hearings.

State Senator Kelda Roys explains that the U.S. Senate is a minority institution, requiring more than a majority of Democrats to control the chamber, and that the 60-vote requirement for cloture is necessary to end debate and move forward with a bill. The evidence also shows that Senate Democrats failed to advance legislation to protect abortion access nationwide, falling short of the 60 votes needed. This supports the claim that Democrats need more than a majority to codify Roe v. Wade."

However, the evidence provided shows that Tennessee did not ban Plan B, and the legislation passed by the state only restricts access to abortion pills, not emergency contraceptives like Plan B. The law imposes a $50,000 penalty for doctors or anyone who dispenses abortion pills by mail, but there is no criminal penalty for patients.

However, the evidence also shows that since then, laws have changed, and more countries have been added to the list.

The US proposal focuses on sharing information and offering resources to affected countries, but does not include any language that would override national decisions. The WHO would not have the power to \"run roughshod over national sovereignty\" as claimed by Bachmann. The evidence provided contradicts the claim, making it FALSE."

While Zack Nunn was involved in private rescue missions and his organization, Task Force Argo, helped evacuate Americans and Afghans from Afghanistan, the exact number of Americans he personally led out of the country is disputed. The evidence suggests that Task Force Argo has evacuated around 61 Americans as of October 2021, and around 561 Americans in total, including those evacuated since then. However, Nunn's claim of saving over 2,000 Americans is likely an exaggeration.

However, the claim that this debt was solely the result of Perdue's actions is false. The evidence shows that the debt increase was a bipartisan effort, and that much of the debt was accumulated through automatic spending on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, the claim that Perdue's spending is driving inflation \"through the roof\" is also false. The evidence suggests that inflation has multiple causes, including global supply chain problems and changes in spending patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that Perdue's spending is only one factor among many.

The investment was made in a company called BIOMILQ, which is still in the development stage and has no connection to the current infant formula shortage.

However, the claim is also partially false in that it implies that the government actively sought to create food shortages to make Native Americans dependent on the government, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the government's inaction was due to a lack of regulation and oversight, rather than a deliberate attempt to create food shortages. Additionally, the claim is anachronistic, as it applies a modern concept of government control to historical events. The government's actions in the 1800s were driven by a desire to expand the country's territory and establish settlements, rather than to create food shortages."

While it is true that the Biden administration is providing baby formula to detained minors at the border, it is not accurate to say that this is a priority over American families. The administration is required by law to provide basic necessities, including food and formula, to detained minors, as outlined in the Flores settlement. The claim also lacks context, as it does not mention the ongoing formula shortage in the US and the fact that some states are struggling more than others. Additionally, the claim is exaggerated, as it implies that the administration is prioritizing formula for immigrants over American families, which is not supported by the evidence.

The American Academy of Pediatrics also strongly advises against homemade formulas, saying they are not safe and do not meet babies' nutritional needs.

Additionally, the evidence shows that prices have risen consistently since then, with a peak of 8.5% in March 2022. While the inflation rate has decreased slightly since then, the claim is still accurate in stating that the inflation rate has increased from 1.7% to over 8%.

The order was intended to provide training and resources to help school board members understand how to report and investigate threats, rather than to suppress parents' right to free speech. Additionally, the claim that Garland \"sicced the police on parents\" implies a level of direct involvement and control over local law enforcement that is not supported by the evidence. While Garland's order may have contributed to an increased police presence at some school board meetings, this was likely a local decision made by individual law enforcement agencies rather than a direct result of Garland's order.

While some studies suggest that plastics can be a more efficient and lightweight material than alternatives, which can lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other studies highlight the significant negative impacts of plastic production and disposal on the environment and human health. The American Chemistry Council's report cited in the evidence uses life-cycle studies to show that plastic can perform the functions of paper or glass with less material and weight, leading to less production energy and greenhouse gases. However, other studies, such as the Center for International Environmental Law's report, emphasize the high carbon dioxide emissions associated with plastic manufacturing and disposal. Additionally, the repeated disposal of plastic packaging, particularly through incineration, has a significant climate impact.

However, the study's author, Beny Spira, clarified that the correlation does not imply causation, and the study did not conclude that masks caused more deaths. Additionally, an epidemiologist, Emily Smith, pointed out that the correlation could be due to the fact that people are more likely to wear masks when cases are rising, rather than the masks themselves causing the increase in cases.

While it is true that public schools have become more segregated by race and class since the 1960s, the claim is not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that segregation in the 1960s was more extreme, with 0.1% of Black students in the South attending majority-white schools in 1960, compared to 14% in 1967. However, the evidence also shows that segregation has increased since the 1980s, with 81% of Black students attending majority-nonwhite schools in 2018. The claim is also nuanced, as modern school segregation is not the same as the government-ordered segregation of the past. The evidence suggests that the decline of court-ordered desegregation and demographic changes, such as declining white birth rates and increasing immigration, have contributed to the resegregation of public schools.

The attendees listed in the tweet, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, did not personally attend the event, and the initial \"attack\" in the simulated scenario occurred on May 15, 2022, which is the same date mentioned in the tweet, but the first cases in the current outbreak were reported to the WHO on May 13, 2022.

The evidence suggests that the accident occurred on January 21, and the incubation period for monkeypox is typically no longer than 21 days. The current monkeypox outbreak began in mid-May, which is more than 2 months after the accident. Additionally, the woman who was exposed to the monkeys exhibited minor symptoms that did not include a telltale painful skin rash associated with monkeypox. Furthermore, the CDC never reported that the monkeys were infected with monkeypox, and the agency did not provide details about why three of the monkeys were euthanized. The evidence presented is a Facebook meme that stitches together several news events to create an unfounded theory, and it is not supported by credible sources."

The pandemic and its effects on global migration patterns, as well as the dynamics of the pandemic in 2020 and 2022, also played a significant role in the increase in encounters. Additionally, the comparison of April 2020 and April 2022 is problematic due to the selective and decontextualized nature of the data presented.

Additionally, research studies have found that school resource officers do not prevent school shootings or gun-related incidents, and that armed guards are not associated with a significant reduction in rates of injuries during school mass shootings.

However, the claim also implies that mass shootings went down when the ban was in place, which is not entirely accurate.

The evidence suggests that 50% of privately purchased firearms were obtained without a background check, but this is based on a national survey and not specific to Texas. Additionally, the survey found that private transfers were a minority of all gun transactions, which means that the majority of gun sales in Texas likely do involve a background check.

The evidence also shows that support for background checks varies across different polls and demographics, and that some respondents may not fully understand the current state of gun laws. Additionally, the claim implies that the 90% support is uniform across all political parties, which is not entirely accurate, as Republicans tend to have lower support for background checks compared to Democrats.

This data supports the claim that more people die from hands, fists, and feet than from rifles. However, it's important to note that the claim is not entirely accurate, as the majority of homicides (77%) were committed with firearms of any kind, and handguns were used in most of those cases.

While it is true that Chicago, LA, and New York have stricter gun laws than Texas, the claim oversimplifies the relationship between gun laws and gun violence. The evidence suggests that while stricter gun laws may have some positive impact, they are not a panacea for gun violence. Additionally, the claim ignores the fact that gun violence is a complex issue influenced by many factors, including socioeconomic conditions, mental health, and cultural factors. Furthermore, the comparison between Chicago and Texas is misleading, as the two cities have different demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and crime rates, which can affect the effectiveness of gun laws. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it presents a simplistic and misleading view of the relationship between gun laws and gun violence."

Additionally, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Rockefeller Institute of Government also found that firearm deaths exceeded traffic deaths among children and teens ages 1-19.

However, the survey did not ask the participants if they actually got an abortion, and the source of the coercion was not specified.

The claim implies that the entire amount was spent on hiring SWAT members, which is not the case. The aid package was designed to sustain Ukraine for months, not just to hire SWAT members. Additionally, the claim does not take into account the actual cost of hiring and training SWAT members, which would likely be much higher than $80,000 per person. Furthermore, the claim does not consider the effectiveness of having SWAT members at every school front door, as research suggests that arming teachers or having armed law enforcement on campus does not necessarily prevent school shootings.

The evidence provided shows that several candidates, including Trump-endorsed candidates, have won elections with 74% or more of the vote.

The Cleveland State University study found that the total economic impact of the 2016 RNC in Cleveland was $142.2 million, which includes $52.4 million in labor income and $84.8 million in value-added impact. However, the VISIT Milwaukee estimate of $200 million is likely based on a broader definition of economic impact, including indirect benefits such as increased tourism and long-term economic growth.

However, it is important to note that this estimate has not been confirmed independently, and the report does not specify if the costs for clean-up projects are included in the $3 million daily figure. Additionally, the report states that the cost of guarding the materials is only one part of the total cost, as the Defense Department also has to negotiate its withdrawal from seven remaining contracts, which could cost taxpayers at least $798 million and $1.048 billion by the end of 2022.

In fact, the article cites several instances of Republicans committing voter fraud on behalf of deceased voters, which undermines the claim that dead people always vote Democrat.

The US is actually ranked 67th out of 170 countries in terms of gas prices, and the average global price is higher than the US price. Additionally, the claim implies that Biden's administration is solely responsible for the low gas prices, which is not accurate.

Masters was criticizing the government's use of propaganda to win popular support for war, and the quote was used to illustrate the manipulative messaging that he condemned. Additionally, Masters has since clarified that he believes American involvement in World War II was just, and has stepped back from his earlier statement that the US has not been involved in a just war in over 140 years. The claim that Masters called the Unabomber one of his intellectual influencers is also not supported by the evidence provided.

The research cited in the evidence does not provide clear evidence of lives saved, and experts in the field have questioned the accuracy of the estimate.

While President Biden has expressed support for the Green New Deal, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there is no evidence to suggest that his support for the deal has directly caused electricity costs to increase in Texas.

However, the evidence provided shows that this claim is not credible and has been debunked by the San Bernardino Police Department and the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office. The police have stated that there are no credible threats to Walmart stores in San Bernardino, and similar threats have been made nationwide in the past week, but none have been found to be legitimate. Additionally, there have been several reported threats about possible shootings at Walmart around the country in recent weeks that were false, and at least one that led to an arrest.

The evidence provided shows that waiting periods for gun purchases can actually reduce suicide deaths, and that many suicide deaths are preventable through early intervention and access to help. The claim is also disproven by studies that show that most people who attempt suicide do not ultimately die by suicide, and that limiting access to lethal means can prevent suicide deaths. Additionally, the claim is not supported by Wanggaard's own experiences as a police officer or the experiences of people he knew who died by suicide, as his office's evidence is based on a single study that does not support his claim."

The evidence also shows that the USDA publishes forecasts of changes to the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index for foods, but not retail egg prices. Additionally, the evidence provides a specific example of the actual price of a dozen large Grade A eggs in April, which was $2.52, and calculates the expected price increase based on the USDA's forecast, which is significantly lower than the claimed $12 per dozen.

According to the evidence, 35 states have laws that require or request some form of identification to vote, which applied to about 59% of registered voters in the 2020 election. However, the type and strictness of these laws vary across states, with some states allowing provisional ballots or other forms of verification.

The Republicans' tweet is misleading in its wording, as it implies that Thompson objected to the entire election, when in fact he objected to the electoral votes of a single state.

Additionally, the military does use miniature drones, but there is no evidence that they have developed a drone that looks and acts like a large fly.

Additionally, the number of Americans collecting continuing unemployment insurance benefits peaked at 23.1 million in early May 2020 and had fallen to around 4.9 million by the eve of Biden's inauguration.

The child died in a fatal amusement park ride accident on July 3, 2021, and the legislation was passed on April 30, 2021, more than 6 months before the accident.

The Charleston church shooting happened more than three months after news of Clinton's private email address first gained widespread attention, three weeks before the FBI announced its investigation, and more than two years after Blumenthal's emails were first leaked by a hacker.

According to the evidence, Beasley did vote to reverse the conviction of Ramar Dion Benjamin Crump, who was accused of being an armed kidnapper. However, the evidence also shows that the case was not about the defendant's actions, but rather about whether the trial court granted him a fair trial. The court's decision was based on the defense's argument that the trial court violated the defendant's rights by preventing the defense from questioning prospective jurors about their possible racial biases.

According to the evidence, JBS had a record net profit of $4.4 billion, Tyson had a record $4.1 billion net profit, and Cargill delivered a record $4.9 billion in net income. Marfrig reported a net profit of $820.1 million, which is a 32% increase over 2020. The evidence also shows that meat prices are soaring, with a 12.3% increase over the 12-month period ending May 31, which is higher than the 8.6% inflation rate and 10.1% increase in overall food prices. The evidence does not suggest that the record profits are due to collusion among the companies, but rather unusual economic circumstances brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

However, a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, including all but one member of the G-7 group. The statement is not entirely accurate as it implies that every other major industrial country has a higher inflation rate than the US, which is not the case.

The evidence also provides a breakdown of the numbers, showing that out of every 100,000 Black people living in Virginia, 14.3 were killed in a firearm homicide, compared to 1.7 per 100,000 white Virginians. This supports the claim that Black people are eight times more likely to die of gun homicide than white people in Virginia."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"American oil is more affordable\" is partially true, but only in the sense that domestic oil production is not necessarily more expensive than Saudi Arabian oil in terms of extraction costs. However, the global market price of oil is a major factor in determining the price of gasoline, and American oil production is relatively small compared to global demand. Therefore, even if domestic production increases, it would likely have a limited impact on the global price of oil and, subsequently, the price of gasoline. The claim is also ambiguous in its definition of \"affordability\", as it could refer to the cost of extraction, transportation, or both. The evidence suggests that the cost of importing oil from Saudi Arabia is relatively low, and the difference in cost between domestic and imported oil is mainly due to the global market price."

This is not a reliable or consistent pattern, and the evidence also shows that there are many other periods where unemployment was below 4% and inflation was not above 4%. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the formula is oversimplified and under-nuanced, and that the theory behind it is not supported by empirical evidence.

However, the evidence provided shows that the Immigration and Nationality Act outlines specific powers of Border Patrol agents, including the ability to board and search for aliens within 100 air miles of the border, but explicitly excludes access to people's homes. Additionally, the Fourth Amendment still protects against unreasonable searches and seizures without probable cause, and federal courts can still hold agents accountable for violating people's rights. The Supreme Court's ruling in Egbert v. Boule did not alter the border search exception law in any way, and agents still need to demonstrate probable cause to search a vehicle or dwelling.

According to the evidence, Plan B is a form of emergency contraception that prevents pregnancy by preventing ovulation, fertilization, or implantation of a fertilized egg. It does not cause an abortion, which is the termination of an existing pregnancy. The fine print on the box does not support the claim that Plan B causes an abortion, but rather explains that it can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg, which is a different process from abortion. Medical experts, including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, confirm that Plan B does not cause abortions and is ineffective after implantation.

However, the claim is also exaggerated, as it implies that the US is the only developed country with restrictive abortion laws, which is not the case. Additionally, the claim does not take into account the fact that some countries have more permissive laws than the US, and that the trend in many countries has been towards liberalization of abortion laws.

The words \"separation of church and state\" come from a letter by Thomas Jefferson, which built a \"wall of separation\" between church and state.

In fact, some Planned Parenthood clinics are even opening new locations. The claim is exaggerated and misleading, as it implies that all Planned Parenthood clinics are closing, which is not the case.

In fact, overdose deaths rose again in 2019 and 2020, and the overall trend during Trump's presidency was an increase in overdose deaths. Additionally, the decline in 2018 was not solely due to Trump's administration's efforts, as other factors such as the sudden rise and fall of carfentanil may have contributed to the decline.

However, the claim does not specify that all energy costs are at a 15-year high, and the evidence suggests that not all fuels are at a 15-year high. Additionally, the evidence notes that prices are volatile and have fluctuated within the past 15 years, so it's possible that energy costs may have been higher in certain years within that time span.

However, the claim is also partially true in the sense that the vice president's declassification authority is not as clear-cut as the president's, and there is some debate among experts about the scope of the vice president's declassification powers.

However, the evidence also shows that wages had fallen significantly behind inflation before that, and the recent improvements have not yet fully made up for the losses. Additionally, when adjusted for inflation, wages have not kept pace with inflation over the past two years, meaning that workers' purchasing power has not increased.

However, the claim that the Biden administration has drained the strategic petroleum reserve to its lowest level since 1983 is TRUE, as evidenced by the data on the reserve's weekly stock of crude oil. Additionally, the claim that the administration's only response to the crisis has been to drain the reserve is also TRUE, as the evidence suggests that the administration has taken other actions to address high gas prices, such as releasing oil from the reserve and incentivizing electric car purchases.

While it is true that Wisconsin does not ask people about their income level to qualify for BadgerCare, it is not entirely accurate to say that people can be multimillionaires and still get BadgerCare benefits. According to the evidence, there is an initial check of people's incomes to ensure they fit within the program's requirements before they can enroll in BadgerCare. Additionally, there are external checks to ensure that people's incomes remain below the threshold, and people are required to report any changes in income that could disqualify them from receiving benefits. While it is possible that someone could receive a large influx of money and temporarily qualify for BadgerCare, it is not a guaranteed outcome.

While National Grid, the company that delivers electricity to customers in New York, has expressed concerns about the grid's ability to handle increased demand, the evidence suggests that the grid will require investment and upgrades to meet the state's climate goals. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that the grid cannot handle the increased load at all. The grid has more capacity in some areas and less in others, and the transition will happen over time with investment in the grid and renewable energy projects.

However, the claim that \"most have been released into the interior and will stay here indefinitely\" is not entirely accurate. According to PolitiFact, most border stops led to migrant expulsions, and only about 53% of encounters resulted in immigrants being sent out of the U.S. Additionally, many immigrants who are released into the U.S. are enrolled in programs or on parole, which allows them to stay in the country temporarily, and some may ultimately be deported if they cannot persuade an immigration judge to let them stay.

The first change is intended to increase the government's ability to audit Medicare Advantage plans and recover past overpayments, which could result in reduced profits for private insurers. The second change is an annual update to the rates paid to Medicare Advantage insurers, which will reduce payments to Medicare Advantage insurers. However, the reductions will be offset by other program modifications that are expected to yield a 1% increase in Medicare Advantage spending per person in 2024. While the changes may result in reduced profits for private insurers, it is unclear whether Medicare Advantage enrollees will feel the effects of these changes. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The evidence suggests that the moon lacks liquid water, energy, and nutrients, which are essential for life. Additionally, the moon's surface temperature ranges from 243 degrees above to 279 degrees below zero, making it inhospitable to human life.

While it is true that the Biden administration has made efforts to increase diversity in its appointments, including the federal judiciary, the claim is also misleading and incomplete. The evidence provided shows that the Biden administration has made progress in increasing representation, but it is not the least representative of the American public. The administration has made strides in increasing the number of women, Black women, and other underrepresented groups in its appointments, but it is not the only administration to have done so.

The evidence provided by geophysicists and experts from the US Geological Survey, as well as the lack of any credible evidence to support this claim, strongly suggests that the earthquake was a natural event caused by the movement of tectonic plates. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that the earthquake devastated areas far beyond the Kurdish regions, including the world's biggest Kurdish city, Diyarbakir.

    "VERDICT: TRUE\nREASON: The evidence provided by Stanley S. Litow, a public policy professor and innovator in residence at Duke University, and the Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce, suggests that having a college degree is associated with significantly higher lifetime earnings compared to those without a college degree. According to the Georgetown study, having a bachelor's degree is worth $2.8 million on average over a lifetime, compared to less than $1 million for those who did not have a high school diploma, resulting in a difference of $1.8 million. Additionally, the Social Security Administration data found that men with bachelor's degrees earned about $900,000 more over a lifetime than men without a bachelor's degree, while women with bachelor's degrees earned about $630,000 more. These findings support the claim that lifetime earnings of someone with a college degree is over a million dollars more than those entering the workforce without one."

The evidence provided supports this claim, citing a study that found a 48% higher rate of degree completion among children who participated in a preschool-to-third grade intervention. However, the evidence also notes that the outcomes in this study are on the high end compared with other academic findings, and that the impact of preschool programs may vary depending on the type and length of enrollment, as well as the racial and socioeconomic background of the students. Additionally, other studies cited in the evidence found smaller but still significant benefits from preschool programs, such as a 12% increase in college attendance and an 18% increase in college attendance.

The proposal is a voluntary program that would allow employers to report tips electronically, and it is not a new tax on waitresses or any other tipped employees. The IRS has also clarified that tip income has always been taxable, and the proposal is not a new audit program targeting waitresses.

While it is true that the Bidens used a legal tax strategy to lower their tax bill, which some people have criticized as a \"loophole,\" it is also true that the strategy is legal and has been used by other politicians, including former President Donald Trump. The Bidens' tax strategy, which involved routing income from books and speeches through S corporations, allowed them to avoid paying 3.8% in taxes that fund Medicare, which could have saved them up to $500,000. However, tax experts consider the strategy to be an aggressive interpretation of tax law, and some have questioned whether the amount allocated as compensation to the Bidens was reasonable. The IRS did not take any action against the Bidens, and the couple paid a total of $5.2 million in taxes for the two years in question.

The evidence also states that governors across the nation, including both Democratic and Republican governors, closed schools in their states in March 2020. Additionally, the evidence highlights that the federal government has limited say in what decisions governors or education chiefs make about schools, and that the decision-making power on when/how to reopen schools was primarily local.

In fact, most available research suggests that suicidal behavior is reduced when youth have access to gender-affirming care. The evidence presented in the article highlights numerous studies that link access to gender-affirming care with improved mental health outcomes, including reduced instances of suicidal behavior and depression. Additionally, experts in the field of mental health and gender-affirming care have stated that the increase in youth suicide rates is complex and multifaceted, and that growing access to gender-affirming care is not a contributor to the increase. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that the risk of suicide among trans youth is higher than the general population, and that supportive families, schools, and communities are associated with lower instances of suicidal thoughts and attempts.

The poll found that 28% of respondents said they were \"very likely\" to have changed their vote, and 25% said they were \"somewhat likely\", which adds up to 53%. However, the poll has several limitations and biases that make it difficult to draw conclusions about the actual impact of the laptop story on the 2020 election. For example, the poll used right-leaning framing of the issue, which may have primed respondents to answer in certain ways. Additionally, the poll did not ask follow-up questions to clarify whether the respondents who said they would change their vote would have switched to Biden or Trump, or whether they would have changed their vote at all. Furthermore, the poll's sample size and demographics may not be representative of the general population.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Sen. Marco Rubio signed a 2021 letter that \"supports waivers that would reduce visual track inspections.\" While it is true that Rubio signed a letter in 2021, the letter did not explicitly call for reducing visual track inspections. Instead, it encouraged the Federal Railroad Administration to continue the use of automated track inspection technology and to respond more quickly to the railroad industry's test program and waiver requests. The letter did not advocate for a specific outcome, and it did not explicitly support reducing visual track inspections. However, it did support the industry's requests for waivers that would allow for fewer visual inspections, which could potentially lead to a reduction in visual track inspections. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that a $2 million grant for Georgia's DeKalb County amounts to a \"private takeover of election offices\" is partially true. While the grant is from a nonprofit organization, the Center for Tech and Civic Life, and is not directly from Mark Zuckerberg, the claim implies that the nonprofit will have control over crucial tasks such as in-person or mail-in voting operations. However, the evidence suggests that the nonprofit will not have any say over hiring election workers, buying equipment, operating in-person voting sites, or managing voting by mail, as these tasks are under the discretion of the elected commissioners and election administrators. Additionally, the nonprofit has stated that it will not attempt to influence the outcome of any election and will not touch \"live ballots\" or tabulating equipment. Therefore, while the grant may raise concerns about the role of private funding in elections, it does not constitute a \"private takeover\" of election offices."

The evidence suggests that Trump's performance in the WOW counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington) has been weaker compared to other Republican candidates, such as Mitt Romney in 2012. The data shows a decline in the Republican presidential vote margin in these counties from 2012 to 2020, with Trump's margin falling below 30 percentage points. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that WOW county swing suburban voters do not vote for Trump at all.

Instead, it is a program that allows individuals to create online medical profiles and link them to QR codes that can be worn on a device, providing responders with access to the individual's medical information in emergency situations. The program does not have a tracking mechanism and does not measure vital signs.

The photo does show an electric charging station powered by a diesel generator, but it is not representative of the typical or everyday application of electric vehicle charging. The evidence suggests that such diesel-powered EV charging stations are not common and are usually used in niche situations where the grid is down or a particular location is difficult to connect to the power system. Most EV drivers charge their vehicles by plugging in overnight at home or at public charging stations along highways or at businesses, which are typically grid-powered.

The card did not restrict the ability to use the card once a person reached their carbon limit, nor did it have any sinister intentions to control people's lives.

The evidence suggests that chlorine is used to kill bacteria and other contaminants that can cause diseases, and it is regulated by federal and state authorities. The maximum amount of chlorine allowed in tap water is 4 milligrams per liter, which is considered safe for human consumption. However, prolonged exposure to chlorine above the legal limit could lead to eye and nose irritation and stomach discomfort.

However, the claim's wording is slightly misleading, as it implies that the child tax credit was the sole cause of this decline. While the expanded child tax credit did contribute to the decline, other factors, such as the American Rescue Plan's other provisions and the overall economic recovery, also played a role. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the child tax credit's impact was not uniform across all racial and ethnic groups, with Black children still experiencing higher poverty rates than white children. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE, as it is partially accurate but oversimplifies the complex factors contributing to the decline in Black child poverty."

Additionally, the claim that the wind turbine uses 80 gallons of synthetic oil derived from 12,000 gallons of crude oil to operate is unfounded, as the amount of synthetic oil needed varies greatly depending on the turbine's design, and the claim that 12,000 gallons of crude oil are needed to make 80 gallons of synthetic oil seems to have no basis.

According to the evidence, the county removed inactive voters who had not voted in two consecutive federal elections, which is a normal process to maintain the integrity of the voter rolls. The evidence does not suggest that these voters were ineligible to vote due to not meeting basic requirements such as being 18, a U.S. citizen, or a county resident.

The report is counting \"federally declared disasters\" which includes events that have met the cost threshold for a federal disaster declaration, not necessarily events directly caused by climate change. Additionally, the report's use of the term \"climate\" does suggest a link to broader climatological patterns, but it is not explicitly stated that the disasters were caused by climate change.

The photos may not be taken at the same point in a tidal cycle, which means they do not accurately represent the average sea level rise. Additionally, NOAA's data from The Battery, which is near the Statue of Liberty, shows a change of 0.95 feet in 100 years, or about 0.114 inches per year.

The rule allows for quarantine and isolation to take place in various settings, including home quarantine, other residential or temporary housing, or quarantine at other locations deemed appropriate by the public health authority. Additionally, the state has not operated camps for people infected with COVID-19, and experts have stated that it won't start.

There is no evidence of a \"final warning\" or a recent statement from the US government threatening to cut off aid to Uganda. The US has expressed concerns about the new anti-homosexuality bill introduced in Uganda and has condemned laws that undermine the rights of LGBTQ people, but there is no indication of a specific threat to cut off aid.

The evidence shows that the state already collects income tax from visiting athletes, and this would continue regardless of whether the Brewers stay or leave. The claim is also misleading because it implies that the Brewers' presence is the sole source of these tax revenues, when in fact, the state collects taxes from athletes in all three top-level professional leagues that have teams in Wisconsin.

The claim implies that Kelly unrecused himself solely to judge the case, which is not supported by the evidence. Kelly's decision to unrecuse himself was likely due to the fact that the case was still pending when he left the court, and he wanted to ensure that the case was resolved.

The claim implies that Bragg has downgraded over 50% of all felonies, whereas the evidence only provides data on the percentage of felony cases that were downgraded, not the total number of felonies. Additionally, the evidence does not provide a clear picture of the total number of felonies in Manhattan, making it difficult to determine if the claim is accurate.

The evidence cites a study that found a 129 times higher risk of death from overdose during this period compared to the general public. While the study's authors note limitations in their methodology and data, the evidence suggests that the claim is supported by empirical research. The additional evidence provided, which reports a 40 times higher risk of opioid overdose death and a 74 times higher risk of heroin overdose death, further supports the claim.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines shedding as the release or discharge of vaccine components, which can only occur with live weakened virus vaccines, not mRNA vaccines.

However, the gross federal debt, which includes the debt the government owes itself, has been above 100% of GDP for the past decade, including during Pence's vice presidency.

The evidence shows that Trump's guidelines and recommendations were inconsistent, and he sometimes gave governors the authority to make their own decisions. Additionally, some governors chose to keep their states open, while others chose to shut down.

The study's lead author has also stated that the claim distorts her research. Additionally, other experts have reviewed the study and found it to be flawed. In contrast, numerous other studies have found that medication abortion is safe and effective, with a very low rate of major complications.

Tuberville's office has clarified that he does not object to existing federal statute and longstanding Defense Department policy that provides for abortion in narrow circumstances.

Additionally, 15 states have laws that prohibit the possession, manufacture, or sale of all machine guns, including those that are possessed, manufactured, or sold in compliance with federal law.

Health experts have criticized the report, stating that it presents no evidence to prove COVID-19 vaccines caused the excess deaths and that the vaccines' safety is best measured by randomized, controlled trials, which have consistently found that the vaccines are safe and effective.

Similarly, some states with restrictive gun laws have high rates of gun homicide, and some with permissive laws have low rates. The evidence suggests that there is no simple correlation between gun laws and gun homicide rates, and that other factors such as poverty rates, trauma care resources, and historical-cultural factors also play a significant role.

Trump was not taken into custody or detained, and his indictment was based on specific legal charges related to a payment to Daniels, not because of his political beliefs.

According to the evidence, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not collect data on which drugs or narcotics cause the most fatalities nationwide, but rather categorizes fentanyl deaths under the broader category of \"other synthetic narcotics.\" However, the CDC's data shows that fentanyl compromises about 90% of the deaths in that category. Additionally, the Washington Post's analysis found that in 2021, fentanyl was the leading cause of death for Americans 18-49, with COVID-19 being the second-leading cause. However, the CDC's data also shows that the leading cause of death for the 18-45 age group is actually \"Accidents (unintentional injuries),\" with \"unintentional drug overdoses\" being the largest proportion, and \"synthetic narcotics\" being the No. 1 category.

The claim that lead paint would have protected people from radiation is also debunked by the experts, who explain that radiofrequency shielding paint is a different substance that contains carbon particles or other conductors and is designed to provide shielding if installed correctly.

According to the evidence, in 1970, 42% of Black households owned their own homes, and in 2022, that number was 44%, a 0.4% increase over 10 years. This suggests that the homeownership rate for African American families has remained relatively stable over the past five decades, despite the passage of the Fair Housing Act and other federal housing programs. The evidence also highlights the persistent barriers to homeownership faced by Black Americans, including discriminatory practices, limited access to mortgage credit, and the legacy of redlining, which has contributed to the lack of progress in increasing homeownership rates for this demographic.

Additionally, the report includes cases of homicide, suspected homicide, suicide, drug intoxication, drug overdoses, and natural death, which are not related to the drug.

According to the evidence, Florida has a low tax burden compared to other states, and various organizations such as the Federation of Tax Administrators, Florida TaxWatch, and USAFacts have ranked it among the lowest in the country. However, the evidence also suggests that the tax burden in Florida is not evenly distributed, with low-income individuals paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to high-income individuals. This is due to Florida's reliance on sales taxes, which is a regressive tax system. Therefore, while Florida's overall tax burden is low, it is not entirely accurate to say that it has the second lowest tax burden per capita in the United States without considering the distribution of the tax burden across different income groups."

Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that the risk of myocarditis is higher from COVID-19 infection than from vaccination.

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim states that Democrats introduced a bill that would ban detaining gay illegal immigrants. However, the evidence shows that the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act of 2023 does not categorically prohibit detaining LGBTQ+ migrants. Instead, it requires the Department of Homeland Security to provide justification for detaining vulnerable persons, including LGBTQ+ individuals, and establishes a \"presumption of release\" for all migrants awaiting removal hearings. This means that while the bill does provide additional protections for LGBTQ+ individuals, it does not ban detaining them altogether. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Social Security is a \"legal Ponzi scheme\" is partially true. On the surface, Social Security does collect money from current workers (new investors) and uses it to pay off obligations to retirees (existing investors), which is similar to a Ponzi scheme. However, there are key differences that distinguish Social Security from a traditional Ponzi scheme. Unlike a Ponzi scheme, Social Security is obligated to pay benefits, and the government is required to make good on the money borrowed from the fund with interest. Additionally, participants are aware of how the system operates, and it is not a secret. Therefore, while the comparison is superficially true, it is not entirely accurate to label Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme,\" legal or otherwise."

The Department of Veterans Affairs estimated a 22% cut for fiscal year 2024 compared to 2023 funding, which could translate to 13 million fewer health care appointments for veterans and significant cuts to benefit payments, staffing, and clinic construction. However, it is also true that the bill does not explicitly exempt veterans' programs from cuts, and the House GOP leadership has promised to spare programs that are popular with Republican voters, such as the defense budget and veterans' health services.

The evidence shows that the average U.S. drug price is 2.56 times the price in 32 other OECD countries, and 3.44 times for brand-name drugs. However, the claim's assertion that the difference reaches 10 times more in some cases is not entirely supported by the evidence. The evidence does show that for some specific drugs, such as insulin, the price difference can be closer to 10 times, but this is not a universal phenomenon.

The bill does make some changes, such as revising the process for keeping voter rolls up to date and adding rules for third-party groups that collect voter registration applications. While the bill does not deliver all of what Trump wants, it is not entirely accurate to say that it \"guts everything\" and does not deliver what the people want.

Additionally, the bill only applies to a county with a population of 2.7 million or more, which is Harris County.

Additionally, the study mentioned in the video is not testing mRNA in food, but rather an oral mRNA vaccine based on cow's milk-derived exosomes, and the mice were not given the mRNA orally, but rather had it injected into their intestines. Furthermore, there is no widespread use of mRNA vaccines in livestock in the United States, and even if there were, the chances of the mRNA transferring to people who consume the harvested food products are extremely low due to the rapid degradation of the components in the stomach."

The change was approved with bipartisan support and does not increase lawmakers' fixed regular salary. While it is possible that some lawmakers may receive reimbursements of $30,000 or more, this is not a guarantee and depends on individual circumstances. Additionally, the change does not circumvent the Constitution, as it is not a law that varies the compensation for the services of Senators and Representatives. The 27th Amendment, which prohibits changes to congressional compensation from taking effect until after an election, does not apply to this change.

If they do not meet this target, they must issue rebates to their customers. The evidence states that an estimated $1.1 billion will be paid in rebates this year, which is in line with the previous year's rebates. However, the evidence also notes that most enrollees will not receive a rebate check because most insurance plans fall within the limits set by the law. Additionally, the rebates are not necessarily a windfall for consumers, as they can be used by employers to offset employees' share of the cost of health coverage or to boost benefits.

The evidence provided shows that Bill Gates has consistently warned world leaders to prepare for future pandemics, but there is no evidence that he has specifically stated that the next pandemic will target children.

The evidence provided shows that while ventilators were used to treat patients with COVID-19, the primary cause of death was COVID-19 itself, not the ventilators. According to Dr. Benjamin Singer, an associate professor of medicine at Northwestern University, patients who had COVID-19-induced pneumonia were more likely to contract a secondary illness, ventilator-associated pneumonia, which contributed to their deaths. However, COVID-19 was the primary cause of death, not the ventilators. The study found that patients who had COVID-19-induced pneumonia were more likely to contract ventilator-associated pneumonia, but the secondary infection was not the primary cause of death. The claim is exaggerated and misleading."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"There's not been a single book banned in the state of Florida\" is partially false. While it is true that the state of Florida has not created a list of banned books, the evidence suggests that many books have been removed or restricted from school libraries and classrooms due to parental objections. The article mentions that 175 books were removed from schools, and the Florida Freedom to Read Project reported 357 bans from July to December 2022. Additionally, the article highlights specific examples of books that have been removed or restricted, including \"Gender Queer: A Memoir\", \"And Tango Makes Three\", and \"The Hill We Climb\". While the state has not explicitly banned these books, they have been effectively removed from educational contexts, which can be considered a form of censorship.

Additionally, Trump's administration proposed a plan that would provide a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people, but this plan was not the same as the Goodlatte II bill.

The evidence suggests that the effectiveness of work requirements in increasing employment varies depending on the specific program, population, and context.

The Trevor Project's data shows that about half of transgender and nonbinary young people have seriously considered suicide in the past year, but this is not related to the presence of transgender athletes in locker rooms. The CDC survey found that teen girls were experiencing record high levels of suicide risk, but this was not attributed to the presence of transgender athletes.

The evidence suggests that there are still strong feelings of patriotism among young Americans, but they may be expressed differently or to a lesser extent than in previous generations."

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim states that the bill charges parents with child abuse for refusing to \"affirm\" their kid's gender identity. However, the evidence suggests that the bill does not charge parents with child abuse for not affirming their child's gender identity. Instead, it adds \"a parent's affirmation of the child's gender identity\" as one of the factors that judges must consider when determining what is in the child's best interest in custody disputes. The bill does not change the definition of child abuse, and refusal to affirm gender identity would not become a crime. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate, but it omits crucial information and misrepresents the actual content of the bill."

While the National School Boards Association did liken the violent threats and acts of intimidation against school officials to acts of domestic terrorism, the Justice Department's response did not label parents who speak out at school board meetings as domestic terrorists. Attorney General Garland explicitly stated that parents who testify, speak, argue with, complain about school boards and schools should not be classified as domestic terrorists or any kind of criminals, and that their First Amendment rights are protected.

Scott said. However, the claim that \"the average monthly expenses have increased by $500, almost\" is partially false. While economists generally agree that inflation has increased under President Biden, the evidence suggests that the average monthly expenses have increased by around $493, not $500, and this figure is based on a specific calculation by Moody's Analytics senior economist Ryan Sweet. Additionally, the evidence highlights that household income is a better metric than individual income for understanding economic well-being, and that the figure Sen.

However, the claim that China is directly sending fentanyl into the US is misleading. According to experts, Chinese drug producers primarily create the chemicals to make fentanyl and send them to Mexican cartels, who then produce and distribute the drug in the US.

According to the evidence, the longest stretch of unemployment below 4% in the past 50 years was actually under Trump's presidency, which was 24 months. Biden's statement is accurate in that the unemployment rate has been below 4% for a long stretch, but it is not the longest stretch in 50 years. The claim is also misleading because it only considers a 50-year time frame, which excludes two earlier periods where unemployment was below 4% for even longer stretches.

I mean I \u2026 We've been having \u2026 you have to also go free market, you have to go capability, you have to do a lot of things. But I'm fine with affirmative action.\" However, this statement is an outlier compared to Trump's presidential record and more recent comments on affirmative action. The evidence also shows that the Trump administration took actions opposing affirmative action, including encouraging higher-education institutions to factor race into admissions decisions, filing lawsuits against universities that used affirmative action, and nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who were part of the majority in the recent cases that overturned affirmative action. Therefore, while Trump did express support for affirmative action at one point, his actions and comments since then suggest that he has changed his stance on the issue."

However, the claim is exaggerated as it implies that all four doctors died under suspicious circumstances, which is not the case. Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick and Dr. Jeffrey Whiteside, the other two doctors mentioned, did not die under suspicious circumstances and were not targeted for their ideas.

However, this growth in spending does not necessarily translate to a 50% increase in the number or size of government agencies or infrastructure. The majority of the growth in spending has gone towards entitlements and direct payments, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, rather than expanding the government workforce or infrastructure.

Additionally, the Health Resources and Services Administration data shows that 100 million people in the United States live in a geographic area, are part of a targeted population, or are served by a health care facility where there is a shortage of primary care providers. This figure is well within the \"tens of millions\" claim. However, the evidence also suggests that not all of these people may be unable to find a doctor, as some may be able to see nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and some may not need regular primary care. Furthermore, the claim that people must wait months to be seen is also partially true, as the Merritt Hawkins survey found that it took an average of 20.6 days to get an appointment for a physical with a family physician in 2022, although wait times can vary significantly depending on the location.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Under 'Crooked Joe' Biden, there has been a catastrophic increase in shortages of essential medicines\" is partially true, but it is an oversimplification. According to the evidence, drug shortages did increase during Biden's presidency, but the rate of increase was not as high as claimed by Trump. The evidence suggests that the number of active drug shortages increased by 12% during Biden's first 3.5 years in office, compared to a 35% increase during Trump's presidency. Additionally, the evidence highlights that drug shortages are a complex issue that can be caused by various factors, including natural disasters, manufacturing problems, and quality control issues, and that relying solely on domestic production is not a guarantee of a stable supply chain. Therefore, while Biden's presidency has seen an increase in drug shortages, it is not accurate to describe it as a \"catastrophic increase\" or to imply that Biden is solely responsible for the issue."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that doctors in the Netherlands are \"ordered\" to euthanize citizens with autism and other minor disabilities, even if the patient does not currently express any desire to die. However, the evidence provided shows that the Netherlands' euthanasia law does not allow people to be euthanized against their will or force doctors to perform the procedure. The law requires that euthanasia be performed only at the patient's own request, and doctors must report the deaths to one of five regional euthanasia review committees, which assess whether the physician who performed the euthanasia has fulfilled the statutory due care criteria. Additionally, the evidence shows that only a small number of people with autism or intellectual disabilities have used the euthanasia law, and most of them had other factors contributing to their suffering. There is no evidence to support the claim that doctors are \"ordered\" to euthanize citizens with autism and other minor disabilities without their consent."

The government has not officially confirmed the existence of alien bodies or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials.

However, the claim is also partially inaccurate because it is based on a narrow definition of heat-related deaths, which does not capture the full extent of heat's impact on mortality.

This brings the total to 458 miles, as reported by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

However, this does not include individuals who are in the U.S. illegally. The law specifically states that people without lawful status are not allowed to become police officers.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: While Governor Ron DeSantis claims to have eliminated critical race theory (CRT) in Florida's K-12 schools, the evidence suggests that CRT was never a standard in Florida K-12 schools to begin with. Educators, school officials, and several Florida public school districts confirm that CRT was not taught in Florida's elementary, middle, or high schools. The Stop WOKE Act, signed into law by DeSantis, prohibits teaching that anyone \"must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress\" based on their race as a result of actions by others in the past, but this is not the same as eliminating CRT. The law also bans teaching that anyone is inherently racist or sexist because of their race or sex, which is a key tenet of CRT.

The indictment details specific actions Trump took to subvert the election results, including pressuring officials to \"find\" more votes, attempting to replace legitimate electors with fake ones, and seeking to enlist the Vice President to alter the election results.

The bill does aim to increase government oversight of pharmacy benefit managers by introducing more transparency and regulation, which could be seen as increasing government control. However, the claim that it is a \"radical health care takeover\" is exaggerated and misleading. The bill's main goals are to increase transparency, require PBMs to pass on rebates to employers, ban \"price spreading,\" and require PBMs to have a process for allowing exceptions to \"step therapy.\" These changes are aimed at improving the functioning of the pharmacy benefit manager industry and reducing costs for consumers, rather than implementing a radical overhaul of the healthcare system.

According to the evidence, wildfires can leave nearby trees and utility poles standing due to various factors such as the way fires spread, the structure of the objects, and the conditions of the environment. The experts cited in the evidence explain that cars have enclosed spaces that retain heat, allowing fires to burn out slowly, while trees and utility poles are less likely to be consumed by flames due to their exposure to the atmosphere and the wind blowing firebrands past them. The evidence also shows that it is common for trees, utility poles, and other isolated features to remain standing even as wildfires destroy other structures in the same area.

However, the claim oversimplifies the progress towards energy independence, which has been a long-term effort spanning over a decade, and ignores the fact that the US still imports a significant amount of crude oil. Additionally, the definition of energy independence is not universally agreed upon, and some experts argue that the US has not truly achieved energy independence as long as it relies on imports to satisfy domestic demand for oil and refined products.

The bill was stalled in the legislature, and Republican legislators ultimately incorporated it into the state budget. While Cooper has expressed opposition to the bill, he has not blocked it.

Additionally, the claim does not provide context about the overall economy, such as the ratio of consumer debt to gross domestic product, which suggests that the debt is becoming smaller compared to the broader economy.

However, it is unclear whether this would affect \"most\" firearms, as the definition of \"most\" is subjective and the number of variables in the bill make it difficult to determine the exact percentage of guns that would be affected.

The claim is also misleading because it implies that the state plan is to turn Lahaina into a smart city, which is not supported by the evidence.

This means he was not in debt, but rather had a positive net worth. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that Kemp cut a deal with Dominion Voting Systems to clear his debts, as the vendor selection process was overseen by his successor, Brad Raffensperger, and not Kemp himself.

The evidence suggests that some companies rely on employees with foreign language skills, and a survey found that adults wish they had studied more foreign languages in college. However, the claim is not entirely true as it oversimplifies the complex issue of foreign language education in the US.

The State Department decided that the conditions were not right for the visit at that time, and the trip was rescheduled for June. While Blinken did meet with Chinese officials in June, the evidence does not support the claim that he went to China immediately after the balloon incident, nor does it suggest that he went \"hat in hand\" or that the meeting was a result of the balloon incident.

The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, which were implemented to curb inflation, are a significant factor in the increase in mortgage rates. Additionally, the American Rescue Plan, which was passed in 2021, likely contributed to the rise in prices and inflation. However, the evidence also suggests that other factors, such as supply-chain disruptions and workforce shortages, have played a larger role in the inflation and high interest rates.

The claim that the Deficit Reduction Act was the last time the national debt was reduced is incorrect.

The evidence provided shows that the average annual income in 1930 was around $4,800, which is equivalent to around $85,000 in today's dollars when adjusted for inflation. However, the average annual salary in 2022 is around $56,000, which is lower than the equivalent value in 1930. However, this comparison is flawed because it only considers the income of the top 10% of earners who filed tax returns in 1930, and not the income of all Americans. A more accurate comparison is the personal disposable income per capita, which has grown from $6,836 in 1930 to $45,343 in 2022, a 6.7 times increase. This shows that average real U.S. incomes have improved substantially since 1930."

The evidence suggests that the state's unemployment rate was already trending downward before Justice took office, and the rate has remained low since then. Additionally, the evidence notes that political chief executives cannot claim full credit for economic statistics recorded on their watches, and that factors such as the coronavirus pandemic and national economic trends also played a role in West Virginia's unemployment rate. Therefore, while Justice is correct that West Virginia achieved a record low unemployment rate during his governorship, it's not entirely accurate to attribute this achievement solely to his policies."

Instead, the bill proposes a pilot program to test signature-verification software, and Section 48(d) specifically states that no executed mail-in absentee ballot shall be rejected by the county board of elections for failing any signature verification.

However, the evidence also suggests that the impact is not as limited as the claim suggests, as students taking courses in the affected departments or majors may still be affected, even if their primary major is not being discontinued.

Additionally, Trump has not repeated this statement since 2016 and has not advocated for punishing women who have abortions as a 2024 presidential candidate.

The evidence shows that there was a discrepancy between the number of votes cast and the number of voters, with 35,312 more votes cast than voters. However, the claim that this discrepancy is a federal crime is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the discrepancy is due to the way the voter roll and ballot counts are recorded and updated, rather than any intentional fraud or misconduct. The state Board of Elections explained that the voter roll captures voter history as recorded in a moment in time, while certified results capture all of the ballots cast during a voting period, including early voting and the tabulation of ballots cast by overseas or military voters, or voters who filed an affidavit ballot. Additionally, the evidence shows that the group New York Citizens Audit received the voter file on December 19, 2022, four days after the results were certified, and that the file could reflect the voter roll from three days before the results were certified or even more than a week earlier. Therefore, the claim that the discrepancy is a federal crime is exaggerated and not supported by the evidence."

Additionally, the evidence shows that Pence's actions on January 6, 2021, were in accordance with his constitutional duty to count the electoral votes, and that he did not have the authority to condition the certification of the election results on the passage of legislation. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that it would have been highly unlikely for Congress to pass such legislation in the timeframe and under the circumstances described by Ramaswamy.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the two provisions related to Medicare drug purchasing will indeed save the government $161.7 billion over the next 10 years. However, this amount is reduced by $44.3 billion due to other provisions in the law that spend money on expanding Medicare coverage, reducing out-of-pocket costs, and enhancing certain aspects of coverage.

However, the claim that prices \"continue to do so everyday\" is not entirely accurate. The evidence shows that gas prices have fluctuated over time, with prices peaking in June 2022 and then dropping significantly. Additionally, experts suggest that while Biden's policies may have had a marginal effect on gasoline prices, the price of gasoline is largely influenced by global factors such as supply and demand, and is not something a president can significantly control.

While it is true that Wisconsin has a documented shortage of OB-GYNs, particularly in rural areas, and that the state's OB-GYN residency programs did report a recent decline in enrollment, the evidence does not explicitly link the decline in enrollment to the repeal of Roe v.

The decline in enrollment may be attributed to other factors, such as the overall decline in medical school graduates applying to residency positions, as reported by the Association of American Medical Colleges. Additionally, the connection between OB-GYN residency programs and abortion is not as clear-cut as the claim suggests, as the programs are required to teach students how to perform a procedure commonly known as a D&C, which is used to diagnose and treat certain uterine conditions or to clear the uterine lining after a miscarriage or an abortion. While some OB-GYNs and residency program directors have expressed concerns about the impact of abortion restrictions on their ability to recruit and retain physicians, the evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that the repeal of Roe v.

The Iowa model has specific provisions, such as the prohibition on using data on incumbent legislator addresses, voters' political affiliations, previous election results, and demographic information, which are not present in the GOP's proposal. Additionally, the GOP's proposal allows for a simple majority to approve changes in the third attempt, whereas the Iowa model requires a three-fourths supermajority.

While it is true that New York City does spray pesticides to control the spread of West Nile virus, the evidence suggests that the dosing of chemicals used is considered safe for humans and pets. The pesticides used contain pyrethroids or pyrethrins, which are commonly used to spray for mosquitoes in the US and have been shown to be safe for human use at the dosages used in spray trucks. However, it is also true that the pesticides can pose risks if used improperly, and there is some evidence that they may be linked to neurological disorders and cancers in animal studies. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also important to note that the risks associated with the pesticides are low and that the city takes precautions to ensure safe use."

The evidence shows that the continuous enrollment provision, which allowed states to receive extra federal funds for Medicaid during the public health emergency, was enacted during Trump's presidency, not Biden's. Additionally, experts state that the 20 million figure is an estimate of how many people could have been removed once removals were permitted, not actual ineligible recipients.

The evidence shows that the industry was already on the path to recovery, with investments and job growth during the Obama administration, and that Trump's tariffs and taxes led to a decline in jobs and production. Additionally, experts and studies have found that the tariffs had a negative impact on the industry, with increased costs and reduced exports.

The evidence also highlights that some of these encounters led to expulsions, and there is no available data on the number of migrants who have been allowed to stay in the country.

It is true that the US government has frequently used continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills to fund its operations, especially in recent decades. However, the claim that this is the primary reason for the country's $33 trillion debt is FALSE. According to the evidence, the majority of the federal debt is due to mandatory spending, such as Social Security and Medicare, and interest on the national debt, which are not directly related to continuing resolutions and omnibus bills. The evidence also suggests that discretionary spending, which is the type of spending that is typically funded through continuing resolutions and omnibus bills, accounts for a relatively small portion of the federal budget. Therefore, while the use of continuing resolutions and omnibus bills has contributed to the federal debt, it is not the primary cause of the debt."

However, it also mentions that the US government is aware of brain weapon development and has sanctioned 11 Chinese research entities for using biotechnology processes to support the Chinese military.

Additionally, the evidence mentions specific criteria for getting treatment, including a written \"letter of support\" from a knowledgeable mental health provider, reasonable control of any medical and mental health problems a child may have, and informed written consent from a legal guardian.

Additionally, experts consider Russia's hypersonic weapons program to be somewhat overhyped, and the U.S. is expected to have a more sophisticated and technologically advanced generation of hypersonic missiles in the future.

The evidence suggests that buying Sudafed requires more stringent regulations and restrictions than buying a gun from a federally licensed dealer, but it is still possible to buy a gun from an unlicensed dealer or at a gun show without undergoing the same level of scrutiny as buying Sudafed. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that some states have stricter gun laws than Maine, making it potentially harder to buy a gun in those states. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also oversimplifies the complexity of gun laws and regulations in Maine."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson \"opposes Social Security benefits\" is partially true. While Johnson has expressed concerns about the financial sustainability of Social Security and has supported reforms that would cut back its budget, he has not explicitly stated that he opposes Social Security benefits. Additionally, experts have noted that his record does not necessarily equate to supporting the elimination of the program. Johnson's views on Social Security are more nuanced, and he has expressed a desire to reform the program to ensure its long-term solvency, which could involve reducing benefits or increasing the retirement age. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE because it is partially accurate but also oversimplifies Johnson's views on Social Security."

However, the evidence also suggests that the main drivers of the decline in inflation are factors outside of the administration's control, such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and the decline in oil prices due to a global economic slowdown in China.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that cutting IRS funding by $14.3 billion would actually increase the deficit by $12.5 billion, despite the savings being used to offset the cost of a new spending measure (aid to Israel). This is because reducing IRS funding would lead to a decrease in revenue collections, which would offset the initial savings.

However, the claim that you can't walk over it is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that walking over a chalked message is not prohibited, and it is only the intentional erasure or destruction of the message that is restricted.

The law does include an exception for people with nontourist visas or asylees, who can buy one residential property up to two acres that is not on or within 5 miles of a military installation. While the law does not explicitly allow Chinese nationals to buy land within a 20-mile radius of a military base, it does not entirely prohibit it either.

However, the claim that the money was used to \"bankroll radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas\" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and has supported Hamas and Hezbollah in the past, there is no concrete evidence directly tying the released funds to money given to these groups. Additionally, the claim that Baldwin \"voted to send\" the money is misleading, as she voted to defend a deal that would give Iran access to its own funds in exchange for more oversight over Iran's nuclear operations.

The calculation of the number of teachers is also supported by the evidence, using the median district average salary and fringe benefits from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction dashboard.

A geolocation analysis of the video also confirmed it was not filmed at the music festival site.

However, it is still possible to become a poll worker without going through a party, as the mayor, village president, or town board chair can appoint a poll worker \"without regard to party affiliation\" if the party list runs out of names. Additionally, voters can contact their local clerk to learn about applying and become nominated on a nonpartisan basis.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve's rate hikes were targeted at lowering inflation, not increasing it.

The law does not explicitly state that women will not be charged, and law professors have noted that the language of the law could be interpreted to include women. However, DeSantis has stated that he does not want to jail women who have abortions, and the 1997 Florida Supreme Court case cited by his office suggests that women cannot be criminally liable for receiving an abortion.

The Republican Study Committee's budget proposal does suggest making changes to Social Security's structure, including increasing the retirement age and adjusting the benefit formula for higher-income individuals. This could result in benefit cuts for some people, particularly younger Americans. However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that the Republican plan is a single, unified proposal that would affect all Social Security recipients, which is not the case. The plan is a proposal from a faction within the House Republican Conference, and it's unclear whether it would be adopted as an official plan or pass in the Senate.

While the law does allow for temporary emergency jurisdiction in certain circumstances, such as when a parent and child flee to California in an attempt to receive gender-affirming care, this is not a guarantee that the child will receive the medical care without the other parent's consent or knowledge.

The evidence provided shows that the government is not saying that children of undocumented immigrants are not automatically American citizens. Instead, some Republicans, like Rep.

This suggests that she did not oppose the concept of a border wall, but rather the idea that it was the sole solution to the issue of illegal immigration. The claim that Haley \"opposed Trump's travel ban\" is also HALF-TRUE.

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim states that \"We've had 8 million\" immigrants come to the U.S. illegally under Biden \"and they only sent back 142,000.\" However, the evidence suggests that the 8.1 million figure refers to the number of migrants apprehended at the border, not necessarily the number of immigrants who have entered the U.S. illegally. Additionally, the evidence shows that while 245,000 people have been removed by ICE, there have been over 2.5 million removals, returns, and expulsions under the Biden administration.

The evidence provided shows that there is no evidence of a widespread effort by the left to register people in the country illegally to vote. While there have been some cases of noncitizens registering to vote or casting ballots, these instances are rare and often the result of misunderstandings or errors. The evidence also shows that the process of becoming a citizen and gaining the right to vote can take a decade or longer, and that noncitizens who vote can face serious consequences, including deportation or incarceration. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the number of people who fall into this category is \"minuscule\" and that the system works to prevent illegal voting.

However, this is only one measure of the racial wealth gap, and other measures, such as the absolute-dollar value difference in wealth, show that the gap actually widened in 2022.

However, this statement was taken out of context and does not mean that she refused to call them criminals.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the boosters have been shown to significantly reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations.

However, when considering both state and local government employees, Florida does not stand alone, and some states with low state government payrolls may shift duties to local governments, effectively reducing the number of workers that show up in the state employee column. Additionally, the state's low ratio of government workers has drawbacks, such as employee shortages and high turnover rates, which can pose safety threats and impact the delivery of services.

However, for primary elections, North Carolina's voting period is 45 days, which is not the longest. Other states, such as Arizona, allow absentee voting to start 55 days ahead of their elections. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is accurate for general elections but not for primary elections.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that big drug companies charge as little as $7 for an inhaler overseas and nearly $500 for the exact same one here in the US. While it is true that Combivent Respimat costs around $7 in France, the evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. The actual price a patient would pay in the US depends on their insurance plan, location, and pharmacy, and the quoted prices are for cash-paying customers, not those with insurance. Additionally, the prices mentioned in the evidence are for a specific medication, Combivent Respimat, and may not be representative of all inhalers. Furthermore, the evidence also suggests that the prices in the US are influenced by factors such as rebates and lack of generic competition, which are not present in other countries.

The evidence suggests that the Joint Economic Committee Republicans' report did estimate that households must spend an extra $11,434 each year to have the same standard of living as in January 2021. However, the report's methodology and assumptions have been criticized, and the calculation is based on a specific definition of \"household\" that is unclear. Additionally, the report does not account for the fact that the number of people in a household is not specified, which could affect the accuracy of the estimate. Furthermore, the report's conclusion that Biden's policies are solely responsible for the increased costs is also disputed by economists and the Biden administration, who point to other factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and supply-chain constraints as contributing to inflation. Therefore, while the claim is based on a specific report, its accuracy and relevance are questionable, making it HALF-TRUE."

While it is true that these cities have high rates of gun violence, the evidence suggests that subtracting their homicides from the national total would not be enough to move the U.S. to 189th place. According to the evidence, the U.S. gun homicide rate would decrease to 4.5 deaths per 100,000 people, which would put it in 13th place among 43 countries with available data, not 189th. Additionally, the claim's assertion that these five cities have the \"strictest gun controls\" is also disputed, as two of the cities are in states with looser gun restrictions.

The cards will be used for food and baby supplies, and the program is a pilot with 500 families. The city has earmarked $53 million for the program and its expansion. However, the claim is also misleading as it uses the term \"ILLEGALS\" to refer to migrants who have entered the US illegally, which is a pejorative term.

The evidence shows that Biden does not support a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally, and the new Senate bill does not provide a path to citizenship for anyone currently in the country illegally. Additionally, it takes many years for immigrants to become U.S. citizens, and there is no guarantee that immigrants who gain citizenship will vote for Democrats.

The Federal Reserve and most economists focus on the year-over-year rate, which is not at the pre-pandemic level of 2%.

It also compels the Homeland Security secretary to use an emergency authority to bar people from requesting asylum if officials record 5,000 encounters a day over seven consecutive days. However, this is not the same as accepting 5,000 people into the U.S. daily. The bill does not allow for the entry of 5,000 illegal immigrants a day, as claimed.

The article cites government statistics showing that a record 18.5 million hectares of land burned from more than 6,500 forest fires, and that climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, duration, size, and timing of extreme wildfires. Additionally, a study by World Weather Attribution found that climate change more than doubled the likelihood of extreme fire weather conditions in Eastern Canada, and made the cumulative severity of Quebec's 2023 fire season at least seven times more likely to occur. While arson was a factor in some fires, it is not the primary cause of the record-breaking wildfire season.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not have an official policy regarding the participation of transgender athletes, and the rules for each sport are made by international groups in each sport. The IOC does not dictate the rules or eligibility requirements for each sport it oversees. The evidence also shows that USA Boxing, the national governing body of Olympic-style boxing in the United States, has its own rules regarding transgender athletes, but these rules do not apply to the Olympic Games.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"In Milwaukee, we 'never defunded the police'\" is partially true. While the city did not reduce police funding to reallocate it to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, as defined by the Wikipedia definition of \"defund the police,\" the city did make budget cuts and reductions in police positions. Specifically, the city cut 120 police positions in 2021 and reduced funding from $304 million in 2024 to $280 million in 2022. Additionally, the city has decreased the number of sworn officers from 1,864 in 2019 to 1,645 in 2024. However, the city has also increased funding for police in recent years, with the 2024 budget allocating $304 million, the highest level since 2018. Therefore, while the city did not \"defund\" the police in the classical sense, it did make reductions and changes to police funding and staffing."

The evidence shows that Democrats have removed, returned, or expelled millions of people, including undocumented migrants, and that voting by immigrants in the U.S. illegally carries serious risks. Additionally, the evidence suggests that most immigrants who cross the border illegally are not interested in voting and that fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens is rare and often the result of misunderstandings or errors.

However, the evidence suggests that the government has taken significant steps to address the fentanyl crisis, including increasing funding for border security, seizing large quantities of fentanyl, and proposing legislation to control the production and trafficking of fentanyl. In contrast, the government's actions regarding ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were primarily focused on addressing misinformation and misuse of these drugs, rather than actively stopping their distribution.

In fact, multiple polls cited in the article show that a majority of Americans do not believe the election was rigged, with some polls showing as low as 30% of respondents believing Biden's win was illegitimate.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that President Joe Biden was \"rushed to hospital unexpectedly\" is partially true. While Biden did visit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on February 28, 2023, for a physical exam, there is no evidence to suggest that he was rushed to the hospital in an emergency or that his visit was unannounced. According to the evidence, Biden's visit was scheduled and announced in advance, and he was recorded leaving the White House on foot and unassisted, then boarding Marine One, the presidential helicopter, before arriving at the hospital. The claim that the White House press pool was \"stunned\" by the visit is also unfounded, as the pool reports from February 28 support Biden's explanation that he would travel to Walter Reed for his physical. However, it is true that the visit was unusual in that the White House press pool was not informed of the visit in advance, which is typically the case.

Additionally, the evidence also mentions that using a different count of wards that includes wards where no voters live, the average number of votes per ward is 2.9 votes.

However, the evidence also shows that this claim is based on a specific metric that only includes \"returns and removals\" and does not include Title 42 expulsions. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the proportion of returns and removals to encounters has decreased over time, which may affect the overall effectiveness of the administration's deportation efforts.

However, not all migrants are given a smartphone or a tablet, and the devices are only provided if they don't have one at the time they're enrolled in the program.

However, the claim is not entirely accurate because the savings are not immediate and will take several years to materialize. Additionally, not all of the savings will be permanent, as some will be funneled into related provisions that expand access and lower out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries.

The evidence shows that Wisconsin lost 2,300 manufacturing jobs from September 2022 to September 2023, which is a significant reduction, but not 6,000. The claim is partially true. On the other hand, the evidence confirms that Wisconsin did lose 455 dairy farms from January 2023 to January 2024, which is accurate. However, the claim implies that this is solely due to Biden's policies, which is not supported by the evidence. The decline of dairy farms is a long-term trend fueled by various factors, including global competition, labor issues, and environmental regulations, which have been ongoing for decades. Therefore, the claim is also partially false. Overall, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

Instead, the warnings were issued in anticipation of large crowds and potential traffic issues, which could lead to difficulties accessing food, gas, and supplies.

According to the evidence, during Biden's presidency, foreign-born workers have indeed experienced faster job growth than native-born workers. However, the data also shows that native-born workers have still gained jobs, with a net increase of almost 5.7 million workers from February 2021 to February 2024. This means that not all net job creation has gone to foreign-born workers, as Vance claimed. The correct figure is around 47% of jobs created during Biden's presidency went to foreign-born workers, not 100%. The claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but exaggerates the extent of job creation among foreign-born workers."

This \"golden share\" gives the Chinese government board seats, voting power, and a say in business decisions. However, this does not mean that the Chinese government has direct ownership or control over ByteDance or TikTok. The majority of ByteDance's shares are owned by international investors, and the company's global operations, including TikTok, are not subject to Chinese government control.

    "VERDICT: TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Miami's immigration courts have the \"largest backlog of any court in this country with 10% of the overall immigration cases.\" The evidence provided confirms this, stating that Miami-Dade County has the largest backlog of any court in the country, with 10% of the overall immigration cases. Additionally, the evidence states that the Miami Immigration Court has a backlog of about 290,000 pending cases, which makes up almost 10% of immigration cases in the U.S.\n\nThe claim also states that \"more than 90% of people lose their asylum claims.\" The evidence provided shows that in Miami, asylum claims were denied in about 73% of the 67,000 cases decided since 2000, and the average rejection rate in the 2023-24 fiscal year was 67%. While this is not exactly 90%, it is close enough to be considered TRUE. The evidence also mentions that people detained at the Miami-Krome immigration detention center have a 92% denial rate, which further supports the claim. However, it's worth noting that the denial rate may not be entirely accurate due to the reasons mentioned in the evidence, such as the use of prosecutorial discretion and the fact that asylum cases can be closed for multiple reasons unrelated to the cases' merits. Nevertheless, the overall trend suggests that a significant majority of asylum claims are denied."

While it is true that adverse possession laws allow individuals to claim ownership of a property if they have continuously occupied it without permission for a certain period of time (which varies by state), the claim is misleading because it implies that anyone can simply take over an abandoned house without any legal consequences. In reality, the process of adverse possession is more complex and requires meeting specific conditions, such as paying property taxes and demonstrating good faith in occupying the property. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that some states have laws that criminalize squatting or make it easier for property owners to remove squatters. The claim is also misleading because it does not provide context about the nuances of adverse possession laws, such as the requirement to continuously occupy the property for a certain period of time, the need to demonstrate good faith, and the possibility of criminal charges for trespassing.

The National Guard is providing support due to the expected influx of visitors and the potential for overtaxing local resources, which is a common scenario for large events. The evidence does not provide any indication that the National Guard's involvement is unusual or indicative of something more significant. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

However, the claim that immigration is the primary cause of this problem is not supported by the evidence. In fact, the evidence suggests that immigration could actually help to improve the fiscal sustainability of Social Security by increasing the number of workers paying into the system. The claim also ignores the fact that immigrants who are legally qualified to work can receive Social Security retirement benefits after they've worked and paid Social Security taxes for at least 10 years, and that many immigrants will pay into the system for much longer than 10 years before drawing benefits.

The evidence also provides data and expert opinions that confirm the severity of the food insecurity crisis in Gaza, including the fact that 1.1 million people (about half of the Gazan population) will face \"catastrophic\" food insecurity from mid-March to mid-July, and that 677,000 people in Gaza faced \"catastrophic\" levels of food insecurity from February 15 to March 15.

The article mentions that larger companies have paid for appeals bonds of $1 billion or more, and that a judgment of this size is more common in cases involving large or multinational corporations. However, it is also true that securing a bond of this size can be challenging, as the article notes that companies are generally unable to guarantee bonds that large, and that Trump's attorneys have been unable to secure a bond to cover the judgment.

According to the evidence, the average out-of-pocket cost for insulin was $452 a year, not a month, and the average monthly cost was likely lower than $400. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the cost of insulin varied depending on individual circumstances, such as whether the patient had met their deductible or was in a different phase of the Medicare prescription drug benefit.

Experts have pointed out that the context and motivations behind the seizure are different, and it is not a general move against private property.

The fact that Easter happened to fall on the same day this year is simply a coincidence.

While the evidence suggests that support for Roe is higher than it was in the past, it is not the highest it has ever been.

The evidence also shows that support for Roe has fluctuated over time, and it is not clear whether the current level of support is the highest in history. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

The evidence also highlights that abortions later in pregnancy are rare and often occur due to severe fetal anomalies or health risks to the mother, and that doctors and medical professionals do not perform or support the killing of babies after birth.

However, the claim also implies that the GOP has failed to invest in the campuses, which is partially true.

Furthermore, the claim does not account for the fact that immigrants in the country illegally are ineligible for federally funded programs such as Medicare, but they can have private insurance through employers or pay for care out of pocket.

Evers did veto a bill created by Republicans that outlined how the $125 million trust fund should be spent. However, the claim implies that Evers vetoed the bill solely to ask the GOP to release the money without a plan, which is not entirely accurate. Evers has repeatedly asked the Legislature to release the money, and his administration has submitted draft plans to the Joint Finance Committee outlining how the money could be spent without further legislation. The veto was likely due to disagreements over the specific provisions in the bill, rather than a desire to withhold the money without a plan."

The study cited by Vice President Harris found that 76% of shooters obtained their guns from homes, but only 48% of those guns were considered \"accessible\" or \"not secured in a meaningful way\".

In fact, the evidence suggests that some Senate Democrats have voted against measures that would allow for unlimited abortions up to the moment of birth. Additionally, the evidence provided shows that the claim is based on a misunderstanding of the Women's Health Protection Act of 2022, which does not allow for unlimited abortions up to the moment of birth. The act protects the right to an abortion up until the point of fetal viability, which is roughly reached at 24 weeks of pregnancy. After that point, the legislation protects the right to abortion only when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating healthcare provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient's life or health."

While the Dickey Amendment, which was passed in 1996, was widely interpreted as banning federally funded research related to gun violence, it did not explicitly prohibit research. Instead, it was a provision in an appropriations bill that restricted the use of funds for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from being used to advocate or promote gun control. This provision had a chilling effect on funding for gun research, and federal agencies did not pursue such research. However, in 2018, Congress clarified that the amendment did not ban federally funded gun-related research, and funding for such efforts has been flowing since 2020. Therefore, while the NIH was not explicitly prohibited from researching the cause of mass shootings, the Dickey Amendment did have a significant impact on the availability of funding for such research."

The amendment does not define viability, but it does not mandate abortion until the moment of birth. In fact, the amendment reinstates the restrictions of Roe v. Wade, which provided federally protected abortion access until a fetus is viable. The evidence also suggests that the amendment would not change the definition of viability, which is typically considered to be around 24 weeks of pregnancy. Additionally, the amendment does not allow for abortion until the moment of birth, as it only permits abortion when necessary to protect the patient's health. The claim is misleading and inaccurate."

However, the claim is also partially false because it overlooks the fact that Trump's job loss record was largely due to the global pandemic, which was a once-in-a-century event that affected the entire world. Additionally, the claim does not consider the job loss records of earlier presidents, such as Herbert Hoover, who likely had a worse record due to the Great Depression. Furthermore, the claim does not account for the fact that Trump's job loss record was partially mitigated by the fact that the economy was recovering from the pandemic by the time he left office.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel\" is partially true, but not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that Biden's administration did pause one shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel, which was a move aimed at preventing a full-scale attack on Gaza. However, this does not mean that Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel. In fact, the evidence also suggests that Biden would continue to provide military aid to Israel, but with certain conditions, such as not supplying certain offensive weapons if Israel launched a full attack on cities in Rafah.

    "[VERDICT]: FALSE  \n[REASON]: The claim that the aurora borealis sightings were a \"fabricated light show\" created by a HAARP experiment is FALSE. The evidence provided shows that the aurora borealis was caused by a rare, powerful geomagnetic storm triggered by the sun, which was predicted well in advance by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The HAARP experiment, which was conducted from May 8 to May 10, was unrelated to the aurora borealis and studied mechanisms for the detection of orbiting space debris, not the creation of artificial auroras. The experiment's spokesperson, Becky Lindsey, explicitly stated that the experiment had nothing to do with the aurora borealis and that the energy HAARP creates is not strong enough to produce the optical display seen during a natural aurora. The evidence also shows that the aurora activity was visible worldwide, including in South Florida, and was not limited to a specific location. Therefore, the claim that the aurora borealis sightings were a \"fabricated light show\" created by HAARP is FALSE."

According to the evidence, China has a significant aging population, with 283 million people aged 60 and older, compared to 816 million people aged 16-59. This means that there are approximately 2.9 working-age people for every 60-or-older person. However, this does not necessarily mean that there are more retired than working people in China. The claim is also made in the context of a comparison with the United States, where the ratio of workers to retirees is even lower.

However, the evidence retrieved suggests that the prosecution did not delete the records, but rather omitted some calls from the summary presented as evidence. The paralegal, Jarmel-Schneider, testified that the omitted calls are still in evidence in other places, and the prosecution's decision to omit some calls is a common practice to aid the jury.

However, the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that the current rate is the lowest in 50 years, which is not the case. According to the evidence, the 2022 rate is lower than the rates in 1972 and 1974, but not the lowest in 50 years.

Tariffs are a type of tax on imported goods, and they can increase the cost of living for consumers. The evidence suggests that tariffs can disproportionately affect low-income households, who spend a larger fraction of their income on goods, making them a regressive tax.\n\nHowever, the claim that \"President Joe Biden's new tariffs on Chinese goods will 'hit every family'\" is FALSE. While the tariffs will likely increase the cost of living for many Americans, the evidence suggests that the impact will be limited to specific industries and products, and not every family will be affected equally. The tariffs are targeted at specific Chinese goods, such as electric vehicles, semiconductors, and solar panels, which are not essential goods for most households. Additionally, many Americans may not purchase these products or may be able to find alternative sources for these goods, reducing the impact of the tariffs. Therefore, the claim that every family will be affected is exaggerated."

The policy statement, dated July 19, 2022, states that law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.

However, the claim that \"New Yorkers are paying more in taxes and receiving fewer services because of Donald Trump\" is partially false. The evidence suggests that while some high-income New Yorkers may have paid more in federal taxes due to the SALT cap, the average New Yorker actually received a tax cut from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, the IRS data showed that New Yorkers paid $3.4 billion less in federal taxes in 2018, the first year affected by the law. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate in describing the financial impact of the SALT cap, but partially inaccurate in its assertion that New Yorkers are paying more in taxes and receiving fewer services."

This increase is supported by multiple sources, including the FBI and the Council on Criminal Justice. The evidence also suggests that this increase was not solely due to the Trump administration, but rather a combination of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, and changing attitudes towards policing. Therefore, the claim that the last administration oversaw the largest increase in murders ever recorded is TRUE."

Joe Biden did approve the pipeline by lifting sanctions on the company overseeing its construction, but this was after the project was already 90% complete. Additionally, Biden did not shut down the US liquified natural gas export capacity, but rather paused approvals of new projects to allow for more thorough reviews of climate impacts.

The Fairness Doctrine was already being reconsidered and eventually rescinded in the late 1980s, and Fox News did not launch until the 1990s.

In fact, they introduced a bill that would have expanded access to birth control by allowing pharmacists to prescribe certain forms of birth control. This suggests that the claim is partially true, as Republicans in Wisconsin did not support a bill that would have codified a right to birth control, but they did not actively target birth control access either.

Human trafficking experts agree that the exemption does not make the policy \"pro-child trafficking.\" The policy aims to reduce the strain on immigration officers and protect children from trafficking, and it does not impact how the government vets the sponsors of unaccompanied children in immigration custody. Additionally, the policy does not exempt children from being trafficked, and it does not make it easier for traffickers to exploit children.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Lower insulin prices were the work of the Trump administration, not 'Crooked Joe Biden. He had NOTHING to do with it'\" is partially true. The Trump administration did establish a voluntary program to lower insulin costs for some Medicare patients, which began on January 1, 2021, and ran through December 31, 2023. This program capped monthly out-of-pocket insulin copay costs at $35 or less for at least one insulin product of each dosage and type. However, the claim that Biden had \"NOTHING to do with it\" is false. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by Biden in August 2022, went further than the Trump administration's program by mandating that all Medicare drug programs cap out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 per month, including those in Medicare Part B, and applying the cap to all insulin products a given Medicare plan covers, not just a subset. The Inflation Reduction Act's provisions took effect on January 1, 2023, for Part D plans and July 1, 2023, for Part B. The law also capped total out-of-pocket prescription costs at $2,000 annually for people with Medicare drug plans starting in 2025.

The bill's provisions do not explicitly allow for abortions at the moment of birth, and experts have clarified that the bill would not permit such a practice.

According to the evidence, Trump did provide Javelin antiarmor missiles to Ukraine, which were used in the early days of the war. However, the claim also implies that Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to send these weapons, which is not entirely accurate. While Obama did reject Ukraine's request for Javelin missiles in 2014, Biden did provide significant military aid to Ukraine during his presidency, including Javelin missiles, after Russia's invasion in 2022.

The bill only prohibits school districts from forcing staff to notify parents about students' gender identity or sexual orientation without the students' permission, and requires schools to provide resources for LGBTQ+ students and their families. The bill does not give schools the authority to transition students without parental knowledge or consent. Additionally, the bill's provisions are meant to create a supportive environment for LGBTQ+ students, not to allow schools to transition students without their consent.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Trump \"saved Kenosha\" and the governor wouldn't move on sending the National Guard is partially true. Trump did not send the National Guard, but the governor, Tony Evers, did activate the National Guard on August 24, 2020, less than 24 hours after the shooting. However, Trump did have a conversation with Evers on August 25, 2020, and the White House did offer federal troops from the Department of Homeland Security, which Evers accepted. Additionally, Trump's claim that he was responsible for sending the National Guard is exaggerated, as the process of activating the National Guard is typically handled by the governor, not the president. The governor-to-governor compact, as described by Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, suggests that the White House's role was more advisory than decisive in the deployment of the National Guard. Therefore, while Trump did have some involvement in the situation, his claim that he \"saved Kenosha\" and the governor wouldn't move is an exaggeration."

While Trump has made some statements criticizing mail-in voting, he has also expressed support for it in certain circumstances, such as for senior citizens or those with disabilities. Additionally, he has promoted voting by mail in some contexts, such as in his 2024 campaign and through his recorded message for the Republican National Committee's early voting campaign. However, he has also made statements expressing concerns about the potential for fraud and has advocated for limiting mail-in voting. Overall, Trump's stance on mail-in voting is complex and has evolved over time, making it difficult to categorize as simply \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\"."

The number of reported rapes in North Carolina did increase by 53% from 2016 to 2022, according to the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation's data. However, this increase is largely attributed to changes in how rape allegations are documented by law enforcement agencies, including the adoption of a new reporting system and an expanded definition of what constitutes rape. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that rape convictions, which are a more accurate measure of the actual number of rapes, have actually decreased by 8% during Stein's tenure as Attorney General.

Instead, it aims to promote voter registration and voter participation by providing information on how to register to vote, request a vote-by-mail ballot, and cast a ballot in upcoming elections. The order also allows states to request that federal agencies be designated as voter registration agencies, and prohibits civil service employees in the executive branch from engaging in political activity.

The evidence suggests that Black women in the U.S. have consistently experienced higher rates of maternal mortality, typically between two to four times higher, than other demographics, even when controlling for factors such as insurance and income. The CDC's data also shows that the maternal mortality rate for Black women is around three times higher than for non-Hispanic white women. The reasons behind this disparity include a lack of universal health care coverage, no federal guaranteed parental leave policy, and less robust postpartum health care, as well as systemic issues such as discrimination and clinician bias. Overall, the evidence supports the claim that Black women in the U.S. are at a higher risk of maternal mortality than other women."

According to the evidence, NATO's most recent data shows that in 2020, nine allies met the defense spending goal of 2% of their GDP, and in 2024, 23 will spend at least 2%.

Hodges or the repeal of the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act. However, the document does promote a traditional definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, and advocates for policies that support faith-based organizations that do not recognize same-sex marriage.

The evidence provided shows that there have been numerous instances of political violence in the United States throughout its history, including attempts on the lives of presidents, members of Congress, and other political leaders. Additionally, the evidence shows that political violence has been a persistent issue in the United States, with threats against members of Congress and election officials increasing over the years.

The claim is partially true in that the center did make some adjustments to accommodate for security, but it is not accurate that it was shifted to a \"hard perimeter\".

This bill was not intended to allow non-citizens to vote, but rather to ensure that only U.S. citizens can vote.

The evidence shows that Brown has made statements supporting exceptions for these circumstances, and his campaign has distanced itself from a 2022 questionnaire that suggested otherwise.

However, the claim that the US is \"energy independent\" is only partially true. While the US is a net exporter of overall energy and petroleum, it still imports a substantial amount of crude oil for domestic use due to the mismatch between the type of crude oil produced in the US and the type of refineries available. Therefore, the US is not completely energy independent, but rather has achieved a level of \"net self-sufficiency\" as described by Mark Finley, a fellow in energy and global oil at Rice University's Center for Energy Studies.

Additionally, the evidence shows that the number of opioid deaths has risen since Trump left office, but it's incorrect to claim they were the \"lowest\" while he was president. Furthermore, the majority of fentanyl caught being smuggled into the country illegally comes via legal ports of entry, and most people convicted of fentanyl drug trafficking in 2022 were U.S. citizens.

The evidence provided does not support this claim. While Harris has supported antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people, including gender-affirming care, there is no evidence that she has advocated for forcing doctors to provide medical care against their will. The claim is likely a mischaracterization of the Biden-Harris administration's policies on gender-affirming care, which aim to protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination, including in the healthcare system. The evidence suggests that the administration's policies do not require doctors to provide care that goes against their professional judgment or religious beliefs. Additionally, the claim's use of the term \"chemical castration drugs\" is misleading, as the medications used in gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers, are not intended to cause permanent sterility and are considered reversible.

While it is true that manufacturing output was declining before the pandemic, it is not accurate to say that the US went into a manufacturing recession. The evidence suggests that manufacturing output was declining, but not to the extent that it would be considered a recession. Additionally, there is no official arbiter that defines a recession for a specific sector like manufacturing, making it difficult to determine if a recession occurred.

While Trump did propose policies that would have reduced Medicare spending during his presidency, he also repeatedly stated that he would not cut Medicare and instead aimed to make it more efficient. Additionally, some experts argue that his proposals would not necessarily result in cuts for beneficiaries, but rather aim to reduce costs for individuals by lowering premiums and out-of-pocket costs. However, the claim is also partially false because Trump's proposals did include some measures that could be characterized as cuts, such as reducing Medicare spending on providers.

The birth certificate does not address Kamala Harris' race, but it does list her father's nationality as Jamaican, which is a nationality that is predominantly Black.

She has also identified as Indian, given her Indian mother's heritage, but this does not mean she has \"become\" Black at some point in her life.

Additionally, the video's main point, that immigrants in the U.S. illegally are getting driver's licenses and therefore can vote, is incorrect. Florida does not issue driver's licenses to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and people must be U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections. The video also did not provide any evidence that the people in line were Somalis or immigrants illegally in the U.S. Furthermore, the DMV office in the video was featured in a news report about long wait times, and the people in line were described as black Americans, not Somalis or illegal aliens.

The evidence provided shows that Harris has supported a \"mandatory gun buyback program\" for assault weapons, but this is not the same as supporting the confiscation of all guns.

The system is only for people with working credentials, including team and game-day personnel, vendors, and media, and fans are not included in the policy. The facial authentication technology will be used to grant access to various parts of the stadium, but only for those with credentials, not for all fans.

This law reversed a 2003 policy that prohibited issuing licenses to people who were in the country illegally. The law took effect on October 1, 2023, and requires applicants to provide certain documents, such as an unexpired international passport or foreign birth certificate, and pass a written and driving skills test. The evidence does not support the claim that Walz signed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants in the sense that it does not provide licenses to individuals without any documentation or proof of residency.

The program is not entirely \"free\" as it is need-based and students must meet certain conditions to qualify. Additionally, the program is not exclusively for illegal immigrants, as it also covers students who are eligible for the Minnesota Dream Act, which includes students who attended a Minnesota high school for at least three years and graduated or received a GED certificate in Minnesota, regardless of their immigration status.

However, the evidence also shows that the difference shrank by almost half in 2022, with about two times as many Minnesotans moving to Florida than the inverse.

However, the rate was still lower than it was during the final year of his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Additionally, the violent crime rate had been declining since the 1990s, and the 2020 spike was largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and other unusual factors, rather than solely to Trump's presidency.

However, the evidence suggests that the Minnesota Department of Health used a scoring system that factored in race as a proxy for increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, not as a means of racial discrimination. The system was in place for a short period of time and was used to ensure that individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, who were disproportionately affected by COVID-19, received equitable access to the treatments. The evidence does not support the claim that white individuals were discriminated against or that the system led to their deaths. Instead, the system aimed to mitigate the harm caused by systemic racism and ensure that those most at risk received the necessary resources. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

Instead, it leaves it up to the school districts to develop a plan for providing products in restrooms, which could include providing them in girls' bathrooms, unisex bathrooms, or other areas. The law does not require schools to provide products in boys' bathrooms, and legal experts have stated that it does not mandate that products be put in men's restrooms. However, the law does require schools to provide access to menstrual products for all menstruating students, including transgender and nonbinary students who may use boys' restrooms.

The law does not authorize the government to take custody of a child simply because a parent objects to gender-affirming care. Instead, it allows a Minnesota court to issue a temporary custody order with a short-term expiration date in emergency situations, such as when a child is unable to obtain gender-affirming care in another state.

Rogers' work as a sales consultant for AT&T's managed cybersecurity unit and his role as a risk analyst for Nokia's American subsidiary were focused on providing advice and guidance on business and security risks, rather than facilitating Chinese companies' entry into the U.S. market.

This change effectively reduced the number of workers eligible for overtime pay compared to what the Obama rule would have achieved. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that Trump \"cut\" overtime benefits, as the overtime threshold remained at $23,660 after the judge threw out the Obama rule, and Trump's administration only changed the threshold to $35,568, which still left many workers eligible for overtime pay."

The Vance campaign's claim that migrants who entered the U.S. illegally could qualify for the assistance is unfounded and not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that only authorized noncitizens, such as those with a Social Security number, would be eligible for the assistance. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

The claim is based on a misleading connection between Project 2025 and the Republican Study Committee's proposal to raise the retirement age, which is a separate entity.

While he has expressed support for greater local control over public lands and has criticized federal management, he has also emphasized the importance of preserving public lands and has pledged to oppose any federal transfer or sale of public lands. The evidence also suggests that Sheehy's views on public lands are more nuanced and complex than the claim suggests, and that he has not made any statements that would support the claim that he wants to transfer public lands to the ultra-rich.

The American Rescue Plan, which Brown voted for, excluded people in the country illegally from receiving stimulus checks by requiring Social Security numbers.

While the law did not have a significant impact on inflation, the year-over-year inflation rate did decline by more than two-thirds since the bill passed. However, the decline in inflation was largely due to factors such as rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, falling oil prices, and an economic slowdown in China, rather than the law itself. The claim is also misleading because it implies that the law caused prices to skyrocket, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence shows that prices did rise, but at a slower rate than wages, and the inflation rate has been declining since the law's passage.

Economists across the ideological spectrum, including those from the American Action Forum and the Center for Economic and Policy Research, rejected Trump's allegation that the administration was cooking the books. The BLS is a reputable agency with a history of producing accurate data, and the process of recalibration is well-defined and has been used for years.

While Trump has proposed a tariff strategy that would increase prices on middle-class families, the exact amount of the impact varies widely depending on the study. The American Action Forum estimates that the proposed tariff policy changes would result in annual additional costs per household of $3,650 to $4,300, which aligns with Harris' statement. However, other studies, such as the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, estimate the impact to be significantly lower, at around $1,800.

Many factors contribute to rising consumer prices, including rising production costs, supply chain disruptions, and changes in consumer behavior. Additionally, some economists argue that corporate profit-taking is not the primary driver of inflation, and that companies set prices based on demand rather than solely to increase profits. While some corporations may be taking advantage of market conditions to increase their profits, there is no evidence to support the claim that widespread \"scheming\" is driving up consumer prices across the economy."

The law did not increase taxes on families making less than $75,000 a year. The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis cited in the evidence also shows an increased tax burden in every bracket, but this analysis did not include other money-saving provisions in the law. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center also found that any tax change affecting the bottom 80% of taxpayers is extremely small. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

However, the claim is incomplete and misleading because it does not provide the full context. The NCVS data only covers a specific 18-month period, and other sources, such as the FBI data, show a decline in violent crime since Trump left office. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that the NCVS methodology differs from the FBI's, which may affect the accuracy of the results. Furthermore, the claim is also based on outdated data, as the most recent official full-year FBI data covers 2022, and newer data shows crime decreasing.

The IRS planned to hire more workers, but not all in enforcement, and the agency has said it focuses enforcement against large corporations and wealthy taxpayers.

Kamala Harris' plan to tax unrealized capital gains does not mean that homeowners will have to pay taxes on the increased value of their houses every year, even if they don't sell them. According to the evidence, the tax would only apply to people with a net worth of more than $100 million, and only to the portion of their wealth that is in tradable assets, such as publicly traded stock. Homeowners with non-tradable assets, such as real estate, would not be affected. Additionally, the tax would only be applied after a realized event, such as when the asset is sold.

In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that Kamala Harris' border policies led to a similar number of family separations. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the Trump administration's policy was unique in its scope and impact, with immigration experts stating that it was the only policy that affirmatively resulted in the separation of children from their parents. The claim is also misleading in that it conflates unaccompanied minors with children separated from their parents at the border, which are two distinct categories.

The evidence presented shows that consumers bear the burden of tariffs, and the benefits to producers and the government are often outweighed by the costs to consumers.

Sen. Casey voted no on a procedural vote about whether to consider an amendment that would have limited foreign exports of oil from the reserve, but he did not vote on the sale itself.

Her proposals, such as price controls, are not communist or Marxist in nature, but rather aimed at making the market more fair and affordable.

The bill was passed by the House but is unlikely to pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Additionally, federal law already prohibits non-citizens, including immigrants in the country illegally, from voting in federal elections.

While the plan does propose reducing federal funding for K-12 schools, it does not eliminate all federal funding. The majority of K-12 school funding comes from state and local governments, and the federal government only provides around 8-10% of funding. The plan would reduce this federal share by transitioning some programs to block grants and canceling others, which would result in a reduction in funding for some schools, particularly those that rely heavily on federal funding.

The evidence suggests that the number of non-citizens removed is lower than 16,000. For example, in Texas, about 6,500 potential non-citizens were removed from the voter rolls, and in Virginia, 6,303 non-citizens were removed. Alabama removed 3,251 individuals who were registered to vote but had been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security.

While Harris did cast the tiebreaking vote on the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, which some economists argue contributed to inflation, the claim that she caused the worst inflation in American history is an exaggeration. The evidence suggests that the pandemic, supply chain shortages, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine were the primary drivers of inflation, and the American Rescue Plan was just one factor among many. Additionally, the claim that a typical American family lost $28,000 due to inflation is also an exaggeration, as the actual cost of inflation is estimated to be around 1-4 percentage points, which translates to a smaller amount. Overall, while Harris' vote did contribute to inflation, the claim is an overstatement and should be considered HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Florida's Amendment 3 is \"the monopoly amendment\" is partially true. While the amendment does allow medical marijuana treatment centers to be grandfathered into the recreational marijuana business, it does not eliminate competition or bar companies from entering the market. The amendment also allows the Florida Legislature to issue additional licenses to expand the list of marijuana sellers and distributors. However, the amendment's opponents argue that the grandfathering provision and the lack of a requirement for the state to issue additional licenses could lead to a limited market dominated by a few sellers, which could be seen as a form of monopoly. The amendment's proponents argue that the market will be competitive and that the Florida Legislature has the authority to expand the market if needed. Overall, the claim is half-true because while the amendment does have provisions that could potentially lead to a limited market, it does not eliminate competition entirely."

The Biden administration, on the other hand, implemented the Medicare drug price negotiation policy included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which allows Medicare to negotiate prices directly with pharmaceutical companies.

The Defense Department and experts confirm that US service members are serving in areas where hostile actions may occur, and there have been instances of US service members being killed or injured while serving abroad.

The evidence suggests that all states have laws that make it illegal to kill a baby, regardless of whether the baby was just born or is a few months old. Additionally, the claim that governors like Tim Walz repealed legal rights of children born alive after an abortion is also misleading, as the evidence suggests that the law in Minnesota was updated to clarify the medical care for infants who are born alive, rather than repealing any legal rights.

Additionally, the claim that Craig \"tried to raise taxes six times\" is misleading, as the city's final budget exceeded the tax cap in only two instances, and in both cases, the city aldermen passed the budget with a veto-proof majority, making it impossible for Craig to sustain a veto. While Craig did propose budgets that increased spending within voter-approved limits from 2018 to 2023, this is not the same as \"trying to raise taxes.\" Overall, the claim is half-true because it takes out of context Craig's proposal of a city sales tax and exaggerates the number of times she tried to raise taxes."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Joyce Craig opposed a bill that would prevent New Hampshire municipalities from becoming sanctuary cities, which is TRUE. However, the evidence also shows that Craig's opposition to the bill was not solely based on her stance on sanctuary cities, but also on concerns about local control, the potential impact on relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities, and the lack of additional funding and training for local police. Additionally, Manchester's policies on immigration cooperation with federal authorities have been in place since 2011, under a Republican mayor, and Craig has not advocated for changing these policies. Therefore, while Craig did oppose the bill, her opposition was not solely focused on preventing New Hampshire from becoming a sanctuary state."

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing sector employment fell by 48,000 from its prepandemic peak in January 2019 to February 2020, which is a quarter of the number cited by Kamala Harris. Additionally, the 200,000 figure includes job losses during the pandemic years, not just before the pandemic. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is accurate that manufacturing jobs were declining before the pandemic, but the exact number of job losses is not supported by the evidence."

However, the evidence provided shows that the removals were part of a normal voter roll cleanup process, which is required by state and federal laws. The removals were gradual over a period of 20 months, and the majority of the removed registrants were inactive records, including those who had moved out of state, died, or failed to respond to confirmation mailers. There is no evidence to suggest that the removals were done with the intention of influencing the outcome of an election. The North Carolina State Board of Elections and election experts have confirmed that the removals were part of normal list maintenance, and not a \"purge\" or an attempt to disenfranchise eligible voters.

Caterpillar, the other company, did lay off 1,200 workers, but it was due to a combination of factors, including declining sales and production shifts to other countries.

However, the amendment was part of a political tactic and did not have any policy effect, as the federal government already had laws preventing spending on health coverage for migrants in the U.S. illegally.

However, the evidence also suggests that New York state already has laws and regulations in place that allow transgender athletes to compete on teams that align with their gender identity, and that these protections are already part of state law and regulations. Therefore, while the ERA may potentially strengthen these protections, it is not clear that it would necessarily mandate that biological males compete in girls' sports."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Kamala Harris \"let in\" 13,099 convicted murderers, which is partially true. However, the evidence shows that these individuals were not necessarily let in by Kamala Harris or the Biden-Harris administration. The data provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shows that the 13,099 individuals were convicted of homicide and are on the agency's nondetained docket, meaning they are not in immigration detention. The data also shows that most of these individuals did not enter the US in the last three and a half years, and many are serving sentences in federal, state, or local law enforcement custody. Additionally, the data does not clarify whether these individuals entered the US illegally or legally, and some may have been convicted of crimes outside of the US. Therefore, while Kamala Harris did not directly \"let in\" these individuals, the claim is partially true in the sense that the Biden-Harris administration has not detained all of these individuals, likely due to the Supreme Court's 2001 ruling that people cannot be detained indefinitely."

Additionally, her campaign and public statements have consistently emphasized the need to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and possession, and she has called for more enforcement and treatment options to address the opioid crisis.

This suggests that while he may believe he should have a say in the decision, he also respects the democratic process and the will of the people. However, it is important to note that Rogers has a history of voting for abortion restrictions and has co-sponsored bills that would outlaw abortion without exceptions for rape or incest, which contradicts his current stance.

Additionally, the article states that the Bidens did travel to Delaware over the weekend following Hurricane Helene's landfall, but it does not mention them lounging on the beach during the storm.

In fact, the White House released a fact sheet detailing the administration's relief efforts, which included approving major disaster declarations, declaring emergency declarations, and providing resources to affected areas. Additionally, Biden directed his team to provide every available resource as fast as possible to the affected communities.

The evidence also shows that Biden's team was in constant contact with state and local leaders and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell was stationed in Asheville, North Carolina, to oversee recovery efforts.

According to the evidence, Americans evacuating Israel on U.S.-chartered planes were asked to sign an agreement to repay the U.S. government prior to departure, which means they were not flown out for free. However, the reimbursement process is structured as a loan, which may have led to the misconception that the flights were free.

Additionally, FEMA has stated that no money is being diverted from disaster response needs, including international or border-related issues, and that disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through a dedicated Disaster Relief Fund.

Additionally, the evidence shows that the Biden-Harris administration did not transfer money from the Disaster Relief Fund to the Shelter and Services Program, and that the program is funded separately from disaster relief efforts. Furthermore, the evidence shows that the Trump administration, not the Biden administration, shifted FEMA funding to address immigration efforts, including transferring $155 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to immigration efforts.

However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that FEMA has prioritized LGBTQ+ people above others, which is not supported by the evidence.

According to the evidence, unemployment rates have trended upward for nearly two years, and the most recent rates are higher than the record lows.

Meanwhile, teachers, nurses, and firefighters have an effective tax rate ranging from 5% to 15%.

However, it is unclear whether this increase in seizures means that the flow of fentanyl has actually decreased or if it is just a result of more effective interdiction efforts.

Additionally, Adams has denied ever campaigning for Robinson or working with him in any capacity. However, the claim is also partially false because it implies that Adams actively supported Robinson's agenda, which is not supported by the evidence. Adams has stated that she does not recall posting the voter's guide and has not endorsed Robinson's views on abortion. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

In fact, the evidence suggests that Governor Cooper and his office were working with various organizations and government agencies to coordinate relief efforts and provide aid to those affected by Hurricane Helene. The claim is likely a political smear or misinformation spread by former President Trump. The evidence includes statements from Governor Cooper, the North Carolina National Guard, and other organizations that contradict the claim, as well as evidence of relief efforts and aid being provided to those affected by the hurricane.

While Lassiter has expressed support for using public funds for private schools and has appeared at events with politicians who have made statements about cutting education funding, there is no evidence that he has specifically campaigned for the largest-ever school funding cut or ending science education. Additionally, the claim's assertion that Lassiter has \"repeatedly campaigned\" for these positions is not supported by the evidence provided. Lassiter has expressed concerns about accountability and transparency in education funding and has called for more funding for public schools, but there is no evidence that he has advocated for the specific policies mentioned in the claim.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the wage gap actually widened under Trump. Additionally, the evidence shows that wages for Black Americans and Black men rose even faster under President Biden, with an increase of about 6% and 5.7%, respectively.

The claim is likely based on a misinterpretation of the Tax Foundation report, which actually estimates a tax increase of $2,800 if the 2017 tax law were to expire, but this is not relevant to Harris' plan, which only proposes to end certain provisions of the law for high-income taxpayers.

The claim is inaccurate and misleading. Harris has proposed lifting the income cap beyond which the government stops taxing workers, which would affect working-age taxpayers who earn at least $168,600, not struggling seniors.

According to the evidence, Mandela's team had unsuccessfully tried to find a plane after negotiating with the U.S. government and private charter companies, but the U.S. government did provide support for Mandela's tour in other ways, such as providing security and logistical assistance. Additionally, the plane provided by Trump was not a charitable donation, but rather a business transaction, as Mandela's team rented the plane for $130,000.

However, the claim is also misleading because it does not account for inactive voters, who are still eligible to vote but are slated for cancellation due to inactivity.

Additionally, the claim does not consider the fact that Michigan's voter rolls include military and overseas voters living abroad, 16- and 17-year-olds who have preregistered to vote, and individuals who have obtained or updated their driver's license or state ID, which can automatically update their voter registration.

However, these amendments did not address athletic eligibility, and federal law rarely dictates who is eligible for specific sports.

In fact, the Postal Service has used the same procedures for previous general elections, and the \"extraordinary measures\" implemented for the 2024 election are consistent with those used in 2020 and 2022.

The measure, Proposition 57, allowed people convicted of nonviolent felony offenses to be eligible for parole earlier, but it did not redefine the crimes mentioned in the claim. The definition of nonviolent crimes was based on existing state law, and the crimes mentioned in the claim were not on the list of violent felonies.

Additionally, county officials have the leeway to determine voter intent, and if a voter has filled in a box for another candidate, they could still count the vote for that candidate.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence provided does not support the claim that President-elect Donald Trump has been to Epstein's island. While Trump and Epstein were acquaintances and operated in the same social circles in the 1990s, there is no documented evidence that Trump visited Epstein's private island, Little St. James in the Virgin Islands, where Epstein allegedly sexually abused underage girls. Trump himself has denied visiting the island, and flight logs show that Trump flew on Epstein's private plane in the 1990s between Palm Beach and New York, but there is no evidence Trump visited the island. Additionally, many other high-profile people, including former President Bill Clinton, were also recorded as guests on Epstein's plane. The claim is likely FALSE."

The evidence suggests that the claim is unfounded and lacks credible evidence. Election officials, experts, and monitoring groups have reported no incidents of compromised election security or evidence of votes being stolen or manipulated. The fluctuations in voter turnout are attributed to natural variations in voter participation, and experts have stated that there is no evidence of fraud or manipulation.

The evidence shows that the election infrastructure is secure, and there is no evidence of malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of the election. The claim is based on speculation and conspiracy theories, and the numbers are not adding up because of the ongoing counting process and the fact that some states still have deadlines for accepting late-arriving ballots.

The claim is likely based on misinformation and conspiracy theories that have been debunked by fact-checkers and election officials. The evidence also suggests that shifts in vote totals from election to election are normal and do not necessarily indicate fraud.

Additionally, Biden's administration repatriated more people than Trump's administration, with about 3.6 million people repatriated under Biden compared to about 313,000 under Trump. The evidence also highlights that the change in immigration data tracking during the pandemic makes it challenging to fairly compare entries across different administrations, but it does not support Pelosi's claim that fewer people came in under Biden than under Trump.

Some states that do not require voter ID, such as Oregon, use other methods to verify voters' identities, while others, like Washington state, request identification but hold all elections by mail.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that Casey's campaign is trying to count votes from non-citizens. In fact, the evidence suggests that the issue of non-citizens casting ballots did not come up during the review of provisional ballots in several counties, and no one has provided evidence that non-citizens voted in Pennsylvania.

There is no evidence to suggest that the layoffs were specifically due to expected tariffs. In fact, Nissan executives and the company's news release did not mention tariffs as a factor in the layoffs.

However, the difference is relatively small, and the claim is still generally true in the sense that the state has experienced significant job growth during her tenure.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the majority of the aid has been used for legitimate purposes, such as military equipment and humanitarian assistance.

The bill only ended the governor's ability to increase unemployment benefits in the future, not take away existing benefits. Additionally, the state has already allocated over $1 billion in aid relief to Helene victims, and the governor's office has not disputed that the bill leaves the current unemployment benefits untouched. However, the claim that Republicans \"took money away from western North Carolina\" is an exaggeration, as it implies that the bill took away existing funds, which is not the case.

The Federal News Network survey found that 30% of respondents work entirely remotely, and another 64% work a hybrid of in-office and remote. However, the evidence also suggests that the 1% figure is likely an exaggeration, as other surveys by federal agencies have found that a much larger percentage of federal employees work remotely. The Office of Personnel Management found that 14% of federal employees work remotely full-time, and the Office of Management and Budget found that half of federal workers aren't eligible to work remotely.

The evidence states that Trump's children were born in New York City, and as long as one parent is a US citizen at the time of birth, the child is automatically a US citizen. The evidence also mentions that Trump's children's mothers were US citizens at the time of their births, which would make them eligible for US citizenship.

There is no credible evidence or reports of a second attack in New Orleans, and the FBI has not announced a manhunt for four suspects.

While it is true that the county is collecting taxes based on the pre-Helene assessments, it is not entirely accurate to say that the assessments no longer apply. According to the evidence, the county is still using the 2021 assessments, which were in place before the hurricane. The county is not waiving or reducing property taxes for Helene-damaged properties, as state law prohibits it from doing so. However, the county is encouraging property owners to report damage to their properties, which will be reflected in the next assessment. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially accurate but also omits important context and information."

While it is true that some states, like California, may take longer to finish counting ballots due to their laws and procedures, it is not accurate to imply that the vote counting is still ongoing in all areas. The evidence shows that the votes have been counted, the states have certified the results, the Electoral College has voted, and Congress has accepted the results. However, it is also true that some states may still be conducting audits or recounts, and some races may be subject to litigation, which can take time to resolve.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Wisconsin makes it more difficult for its citizens to vote than almost any state in the nation. While it is true that Wisconsin has a strict voter ID law, which is considered one of the strictest in the country, the evidence also suggests that Wisconsin has some election laws and policies that are more accessible compared to other states. For example, voters can register at the polls the day they go to vote, register to vote online, cast an in-person absentee vote, and drop their completed absentee ballots off in dropboxes. Additionally, Wisconsin's ranking on the \"Cost of Voting Index\" has fluctuated over time, with the state being ranked as the fourth-most-accessible state in the nation in 1996 and the fifth-hardest state to vote in the country in 2024. Therefore, while Wisconsin's voter ID law may make it more difficult for some citizens to vote, it is not entirely accurate to say that Wisconsin makes it more difficult for its citizens to vote than almost any state in the nation."

However, this represents a tiny percentage of California's overall water supply. The state's surface reservoirs can hold more than 40 million acre-feet of water, and the state's groundwater basins can hold between 850 million and 1.3 billion acre-feet.

The third scene is traced to a January 10 TikTok video by an \"unusual AI artist\" and is labeled as \"Fake Video, AI Art\". The second scene is also found to be from a video shared on Facebook five months before the fires, showing soccer fans celebrating a team's victory. The only authentic scene in the video is the fourth scene, which shows residents rescuing horses from flames in the Eaton Fire in Altadena, a neighborhood in Los Angeles County.

According to the evidence, the trucks were not held back due to emissions testing, but rather underwent a routine safety check with CAL Fire to ensure the engines were mechanically sound. The safety check did not hinder Oregon's assistance, and the equipment was cleared to continue fighting the fires.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Some of these reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years\" is partially true, but it is misleading and exaggerated. While there may be small, local reservoirs that have been shut down for a few years, there is no evidence of any major reservoir in California being dry for 15-20 years. The evidence suggests that most state-managed reservoirs are at or above their historic average storage levels, and experts are not aware of any major reservoir that has been dry for that long. The claim is likely referring to the Santa Ynez reservoir, which was shut down for repairs and was empty for less than a year, not 15 years or more. The claim is also misleading because it implies that the state's reservoirs are generally dry, which is not the case. The state's reservoirs are managed to ensure water supply and flood control, and some reservoirs are intentionally left at low levels or empty for those purposes. Overall, the claim is an exaggeration and is not supported by the evidence."

This means that MPS' tax levy surpassed the City of Milwaukee's tax levy in 2024. However, the claim is not entirely true because it implies that MPS has always had a larger tax levy than the City of Milwaukee, which is not supported by the evidence.

However, the claim is exaggerated as it implies that Trump reversed all the cost caps negotiated by Biden, which is not accurate. The evidence shows that the cost savings negotiated by Biden, such as capping insulin costs for Medicare recipients at $35 a month and capping out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients, were signed into law and cannot be reversed by Trump's executive order. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the plans developed by the Biden administration to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug costs had not taken effect before Trump took office, and revoking the executive order did not immediately shut them down.

Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate, but also contains some inaccuracies."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that CBS News and \"60 Minutes\" replaced Kamala Harris' interview answers with completely different, and far better, answers taken from another part of the interview. However, the evidence shows that the full, unedited transcript and video of the interview reveal that CBS News took Harris' answers in both videos from the same three-and-a-half-minute exchange on U.S.-Israel relations. The claim is false because it misrepresents what happened. The editing done by CBS News was typical of news outlets, where they edit long interviews into shorter broadcast segments or published stories to make them more concise and informative. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that the full, unedited interview transcript shows that Harris' answers in both videos came from the same part of the interview. Additionally, experts from the Poynter Institute for Media Studies have stated that CBS News' edits were reasonable and within journalistic standards."

    "[VERDICT]: FALSE  \n[REASON]: The claim states that \"DOGE has saved taxpayers $64 billion dollars in just 17 days\", but the evidence provided shows that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has not saved the U.S. government $64 billion or more. In fact, DOGE's own website reports a much lower number, not all of which is accounted for. The U.S. Debt Clock website, which is not affiliated with the federal government, also does not explain how it arrived at the $64 billion figure or who is maintaining the site. Additionally, the Department of Government Efficiency's own numbers do not add up, and the website has not accounted for all of the supposed savings. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Wisconsin does not require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer. The evidence suggests that while there is no automatic recusal requirement, judges are required to recuse themselves if they have served as a lawyer in the specific lawsuit. This is stated in the Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct, which says that a judge should recuse themselves if they \"served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.\" However, the evidence also suggests that there are gray areas and that recusal decisions are not always straightforward. Therefore, the claim is half-true because while it is not entirely accurate to say that Wisconsin does not require judges to recuse at all, it is also not entirely accurate to say that judges are required to recuse simply because they have done legal work in the past as a lawyer."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that FEMA sent $59M to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants, which is meant for American disaster relief. However, the evidence shows that FEMA did not give money directly to New York hotels; it gave money to New York City, which was part of a program created and funded by Congress using money from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, not FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The money was used to provide shelter and services to immigrants, not for luxury hotel rooms. Additionally, the claim is inaccurate and lacks evidence, as Elon Musk did not provide any evidence to support his claim. The New York City's mayor office confirmed that it received $81 million from the federal government, with $19 million going to direct hotel costs, but this was not a direct payment from FEMA. The claim is FALSE."

The claim that the US is \"last in education out of 40 states\" is FALSE. According to the evidence, the US does not rank last in education among the 38 OECD member states on any education metric. However, the claim that the US is \"number one in cost per pupil\" is TRUE. The evidence shows that the US spends more on education per pupil than the international average, although it is not the highest spender among the 37 OECD countries. The claim is HALF-TRUE because it presents a misleading and inaccurate statement about the US's ranking in education, while also presenting a true statement about the country's spending on education."

The claim also exaggerates the net worth of Sen. Mitch McConnell, Sen. Chuck Schumer, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The evidence shows that the figures listed in the claim are inaccurate."

However, the evidence suggests that the bill would make it more difficult for married people who change their last names to register to vote, but it would not prohibit it outright. The bill requires states to establish a process for individuals to provide additional documentation to establish citizenship if there are discrepancies in their proof of citizenship documents due to a name change. While this process may be cumbersome, it does not necessarily mean that the individual is no longer eligible to vote. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

However, the claim is also partially true because the federal workforce did increase to around 3.02 million during Biden's term, which is a 4.8% increase.

According to the evidence, Joe Ricketts did donate $500,000 to the Republican party, which then transferred nearly $1.7 million to Schimel's campaign. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that Ricketts is solely bankrolling Schimel, as other donors, including ABC Supply owner Diane Hendricks, Uline president Liz Uihlein, and groups backed by Elon Musk, also contributed significant amounts to the campaign. Additionally, the evidence suggests that Schimel encouraged donors to give to the state party, which would then transfer the funds to his campaign, making it difficult to definitively prove that Ricketts' money was specifically intended for Schimel. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

However, the evidence shows that TC Energy, the company behind the project, \"let go\" 1,000 workers in both the US and Canada after Biden revoked the permit, which is a significant reduction in workforce. However, the claim exaggerates the number of job losses and the timing. The evidence does not support the claim that 14,000 workers were fired on day one of Biden's administration. The correct number of job losses is 1,000, and it occurred after the permit was revoked, not on day one. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"I am not making this up: Republicans have introduced legislation to increase your bank fees\" is partially true. The legislation, proposed by Rep. French Hill and Sen. Tim Scott, would repeal a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would cap overdraft fees at $5 per transaction. However, the legislation does not explicitly state that it would increase bank fees. Instead, it would allow banks to continue charging current fees or increase them if they choose. The legislation's supporters argue that it would not increase fees, but rather maintain the status quo. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is accurate that Republicans have introduced legislation related to bank fees, but it is not accurate that the legislation would necessarily increase fees."

There is no credible evidence to suggest that Ukraine started the war. The claim that Ukraine started the war is a false narrative promoted by Putin and Russian officials, which has been widely debunked by scholars, experts, and international organizations. The evidence presented in the article, including quotes from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, former US President Donald Trump, and other officials, confirms that Russia was the aggressor in the conflict.

According to the evidence, the Department of Public Instruction's survey found that approximately 90% of the districts that participated in the survey (about 320 out of 421) already have some sort of restrictive cellphone policy in place. However, the evidence also suggests that the policy varies significantly by school district, and not all districts have a complete ban on cellphones during class time. Some districts allow students to use cellphones in common areas or during certain times, and others have more lenient policies. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate, but it is based on a true fact."

While the evidence suggests that tax cuts have been a significant contributor to the national debt, it is not entirely accurate to say that they are the single biggest driver. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, tax cuts accounted for $8.4 trillion of the debt, but stimulus spending and annual spending increases also played a significant role. Additionally, while Republican tax cuts were a major factor, they were not the only ones, as some tax cuts were extended or passed with bipartisan support. Senator Patty Murray's statement is accurate in highlighting the significant impact of tax cuts on the national debt, but it is not entirely accurate to say that they are the single biggest driver."

The evidence provided shows that there are chromosomal abnormalities that can result in variations such as XXY, XXX, XYY, and others, which can affect a person's sex chromosomes. Additionally, the evidence highlights intersex conditions where a person's anatomy does not fit into male or female, and their chromosomes may not be XX or XY.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that President Joe Biden's immigration policy was \"a giant voter importation scam\" is FALSE. The evidence provided shows that there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that the Biden administration removed and deported immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and stepped up efforts in 2024 as he ran for reelection. Additionally, it takes several years for immigrants to become citizens, and federal law requires U.S. citizenship to vote in national elections. The claim is also contradicted by experts, including an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, who stated that \"he campaigned as being anti-illegal immigration. He never courted their votes, and he could not court their votes because they cannot vote and do not vote.\" The claim is also refuted by the fact that immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting, and that voting by noncitizens is rare and carries high risks. Overall, the evidence does not support the claim that President Biden's immigration policy was a \"giant voter importation scam.\""

The evidence provided shows that the zero votes for Kamala Harris in precinct 35 in Rockland County, New York, are not evidence of hacking or fraud. Instead, the results are attributed to the voting patterns of the predominantly Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish population in the area, who tend to vote as a bloc in support of their rabbis' endorsed candidates. The evidence also shows that Trump won the majority of votes in the precinct and the county, and that the results are consistent with previous elections in the area.

Additionally, inspectors general have been conducting audits and investigations since the 1970s, and their findings are publicly available.

While Trump's policies may have had some impact, it is unclear whether they are the primary cause of the improved recruitment numbers. Additionally, the claim is exaggerated, as the evidence shows that the military recruitment numbers were already trending upwards before Trump took office, and the increase is not solely due to his policies.

While Abrams was involved in the coalition, she did not \"head up\" the group and did not receive any of the grant money.

The evidence also shows that during the period when employment returned to its prepandemic peak (June 2022), 22% of job growth came from government jobs, but this is still not 31%.

Additionally, the evidence also shows that part-time jobs increased during the same period, driven by people who wanted to work part-time by choice, not because they couldn't find full-time jobs. Therefore, the claim that \"the number of full-time jobs (was) dropping almost the entire Biden administration\" is FALSE."
