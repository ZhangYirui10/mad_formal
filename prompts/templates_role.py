Your task is to infer the intended message or implied conclusion of the following claim.

Claim: "{claim}"

What is the intended conclusion of this claim?

Respond with one clear and concise sentence."""

# === ROLE INFERENCE ===


def user_prompt_role_inference(intent):
    return f"""You are analyzing a social or political claim.

The following is the **intended conclusion** of a claim:

"{intent}"

Your task is to infer **two clearly opposing real-world social, political, or cultural roles** that would likely support or oppose this conclusion in an actual public debate.

DO NOT use generic labels like "Pro", "Con", "Supporter", or "Opponent".

Instead, name **specific groups or identity categories**, such as:
- Political parties (e.g., "Republicans", "Democratic Socialists")
- Professions or interest groups (e.g., "Oil industry executives", "Climate activists")
- Demographic groups (e.g., "Young urban voters", "Evangelical Christians")
- Organizations (e.g., "ACLU", "NRA")

Respond **strictly** using this format:

SUPPORTING_ROLE: <name of the group likely to support>
OPPOSING_ROLE: <name of the group likely to oppose>

Example:
SUPPORTING_ROLE: Environmental activists  
OPPOSING_ROLE: Fossil fuel industry lobbyists
