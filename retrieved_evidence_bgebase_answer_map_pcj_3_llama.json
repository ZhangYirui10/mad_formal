This is a testament to the map's commitment to preserving community boundaries.\n\nMoreover, the map does not disproportionately favor one party over the other.

The Arkansas map, on the other hand, was drawn with the input of the public and was approved by lawmakers without significant changes.\n\nIn conclusion, the newly drawn congressional district map in Arkansas is a fair and compact map that preserves the integrity of local communities, ensuring a more cohesive representation for Arkansans.

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim \"Democrats are advocating for a responsible and transparent budgeting process that prioritizes the well-being of the American people, ensuring that every dollar spent is carefully considered and accountable to the public\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nThroughout this debate, we've seen numerous examples of Democrats' commitment to responsible budgeting. They've consistently emphasized the importance of transparency, accountability, and careful consideration of every dollar spent. From their skepticism of tax cuts without clear spending plans to their push for more restrictions on \"junk insurance\" and surprise medical bills, Democrats have demonstrated a commitment to prioritizing the well-being of the American people.\n\nMoreover, we've seen that Democrats are not afraid to scrutinize the spending habits of others, including the Biden administration. They've called out the administration's handling of funds, demanding more transparency and accountability. This is not a party that is reckless with taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn contrast, we've seen examples of Republicans' lack of transparency and accountability, such as McCarthy's claims about the Biden family's financial dealings, which were later debunked by fact-checkers. We've also seen Republicans' push for tax cuts without clear spending plans, which raises concerns about the impact on the national debt and the well-being of the American people.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented in this debate clearly supports the claim that Democrats are advocating for a responsible and transparent budgeting process that priorit",

The evidence presented shows that Democrats are actually perpetuating a false narrative of reckless spending, and their actions and statements contradict their claims of fiscal responsibility.\n\nFor instance, the claim that Democrats are concerned about the national debt and want to reduce spending is undermined by their support for massive spending bills and their opposition to budget cuts. The evidence also shows that Democrats are willing to spend trillions of dollars without worrying about the repercussions, as seen in their support for the Build Back Better Act and their opposition to the Republican budget proposal.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that Democrats are transparent about their spending is also FALSE. The evidence shows that Democrats are hiding the true cost of their policies and are using accounting gimmicks to make their spending appear more fiscally responsible than it actually is. For example, the Build Back Better Act includes a provision that allows for the use of budget reconciliation, which allows Democrats to pass the bill without having to worry about the budget caps.\n\nIn addition, the claim that Democrats are prioritizing evidence-based spending is also FALSE.

According to the data, Florida accounted for a staggering 84,500 new jobs, which is nearly 44% of the country's total 194,000 job additions. This is a remarkable achievement, especially considering the state's population growth and economic development in recent years.\n\nSecondly, Florida's job growth was not an isolated incident. The state has consistently shown strong job market performance over the past year, with a net gain of 20,500 jobs in the previous month, ranking 17th nationally for percentage job growth. This demonstrates a consistent trend of job growth in Florida, which is a testament to the state's economic resilience.\n\nThirdly, Florida's job growth is not just a one-time fluke. The state's economy has been growing steadily, with a significant increase in jobs in various sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, and technology. This diversification of industries has contributed to the state's robust job market, making it an attractive destination for businesses and workers alike.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that Florida's job growth is not solely responsible for the nation's overall employment growth.

However, this ignores the fact that Florida's job growth is a significant achievement in its own right.

The claim states that Florida's contribution represents only a small fraction of the overall national increase, but this comparison is based on a flawed assumption that the national increase is a fixed and constant number.

Florida's job growth was not an anomaly, but rather a reflection of the state's strong economy and business-friendly environment. The state's large population growth, combined with its thriving industries such as tourism and healthcare, have contributed to its impressive job creation numbers.\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that Florida's job growth is not a one-time fluke, but rather a trend that has been consistent over the past year. The state's job market has been steadily growing, with a net gain of 20,500 jobs in the previous month, and a ranking of 17th nationally for percentage job growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence supports the claim that Florida's impressive job market performance in September played a substantial role in the nation's overall employment growth.

The directive only asks the FBI to investigate threats against school officials, which could include threats made by anyone, regardless of their political beliefs.\n\nAdditionally, fact-checking organizations have debunked claims that the FBI is targeting parents who speak out against critical race theory. For example, a fact-checking article by Snopes found that a viral article claiming that a Colorado mom was targeted by the FBI because she protested at local school board meetings was false.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence presented by Senator Scott and other Republicans is based on whistleblower documents that have not been verified or authenticated. The documents may be fabricated or taken out of context, which raises questions about their credibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some evidence that suggests the Department of Justice may be using the FBI",

They have been traveling together for weeks, sharing resources and supporting each other along the way. This level of organization and cooperation is not something that can be easily dismissed as insignificant.\n\nFinally, the caravan is not just a one-time event, but part of a larger trend of migration and asylum-seeking that is happening across the world. The United States has a long history of accepting refugees and providing asylum to those who are fleeing persecution and violence. The caravan is not an isolated incident, but part of a larger global phenomenon that requires a thoughtful and compassionate response.\n\nIn conclusion, while the migrant caravan from Tap",

However, the evidence suggests that these disruptions are not the sole cause of the shortages we're experiencing. In fact, many experts point to a complex array of factors contributing to the shortages, including labor shortages, transportation issues, and quality problems in both domestic and overseas manufacturing.\n\nFor instance, a recent report by the Brookings Schaeffer Initiative on Health Policy highlights that domestic production is no guarantee of a stable supply chain, and most shortages are caused by quality problems in both the United States and overseas.

By avoiding this issue, West Virginia has been able to maintain a more balanced economy, where small businesses and individuals can flourish.\n\nIn conclusion, the absence of billionaires in West Virginia has contributed to a more equitable and inclusive economic environment, allowing for a stronger sense of community and a more vibrant entrepreneurial spirit. This unique characteristic sets West Virginia apart from other states and provides a model for other regions to follow. I firmly believe that this claim is TRUE.",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position. The claim that West Virginia is not uniquely disadvantaged in terms of billionaire presence is supported by evidence that numerous other states in the United States also lack billionaires. The absence of billionaires does not necessarily dictate a state's economic potential or entrepreneurial opportunities. In fact, West Virginia has a rich history of entrepreneurship and innovation, and the state has made significant strides in recent years to diversify its economy.\n\nWhile it is true that West Virginia has no billionaires, this does not mean that the state is not capable of attracting and supporting successful businesses and entrepreneurs. In fact, the state has a strong sense of community and a growing startup ecosystem, with many successful startups and small businesses calling West Virginia home.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that the absence of billionaires is a barrier to economic growth is not supported by evidence. Many successful economies around the world have few or no billionaires, and yet they are still able to thrive. In fact, some of the most successful economies in the world are those that have a strong focus on social welfare and a more equitable distribution of wealth.\n\nIn conclusion, while West Virginia may not have billionaires, this does not mean that the state is uniquely disadvantaged. The state has a rich history of entrepreneurship and innovation, and it has made significant strides in recent years to diversify its economy. The absence of billionaires is not a barrier to economic growth, and the state has many other strengths that make it an attractive place to do business.",
    "verdict": "VERDICT: TRUE\nREASON: The evidence presented suggests that West Virginia has zero billionaires, as confirmed by Forbes and other reputable sources. While the opponent's arguments attempt to downplay the significance of this fact, the claim's focus on the absence of billionaires is not misleading. The evidence presented demonstrates that West Virginia's unique economic landscape, characterized by a lack of billionaires, has fostered a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities, leading to a stronger sense of community and a more inclusive entrepreneurial environment. The opponent's arguments that the absence of billionaires is not a unique advantage and that West Virginia's economy is struggling are not supported by the data, and the claim's conclusion that the absence of billionaires is a positive aspect of West Virginia's economy is supported by the evidence."

This is supported by Pfizer's research, which has shown that the mRNA vaccines can instruct the body to produce harmless spike proteins that are similar to those found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the mRNA vaccines work by sending instructions to the body's cells to make a piece of spike protein, which is also found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.

This is in line with Japan's approach to the pandemic, which has been characterized by a focus on individual freedom and minimal government intervention.\n\nWhile my opponent has argued that Japan's vaccination efforts have been slowed down due to concerns over myocarditis, the evidence does not support this claim. Japan has not placed a myocarditis warning on vaccine labels, and the country's vaccination pace has not been significantly impacted by concerns over myocarditis.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence presented, I believe that the claim \"Japan drops vax rollout\" is FALSE. The claim is misleading and does not accurately reflect Japan's vaccination strategy or the country's approach to the pandemic.

The Mediterranean Sea flooding the middle of the United States is not a scientifically supported prediction, but rather a misleading and alarmist image created by a blogger. However, the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities are causing climate change, and if we fail to take immediate action, the consequences will be severe.\n\nWe've seen the devastating effects of climate change already, from record-breaking heatwaves to extreme weather events. The scientific consensus is clear: climate change is real, it's caused by human activities, and it's a pressing issue that requires immediate attention.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that the claim is not asking us to take drastic measures or make unrealistic demands. Rather, it's a call to action to take immediate steps to reduce our carbon footprint, transition to renewable energy sources, and adapt to the changing climate. We've seen progress in this direction, with the US rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and making efforts to conserve land and reduce emissions.\n\nIn conclusion",

Furthermore, the image has been shared with a misleading caption, claiming that it represents the US in 30 years if climate change is not reversed, which is not supported by scientific evidence.\n\nWhile climate change is a real and pressing issue, it is important to rely on credible sources and accurate information to inform our understanding of its impacts. The claim being made about this map is an example of misinformation and sensationalism, and it is not supported by the scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the depicted map represents a specific timeline or outcome for the US in 30 years if climate change is not reversed is FALSE.

According to Louis Jacobson, \"most single moms are very poor, under-educated, can't get a job, and if it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death.\" This highlights the need for a more equitable tax structure that takes into account the unique challenges faced by these individuals.\n\nSecondly, the current tax code disproportionately affects low-wage workers.

The statistics are clear: 5.8 million low-wage workers are taxed into or deeper into poverty, and single mothers are disproportionately affected, with many struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe current tax system is regressive, disproportionately burdening low-income individuals and families.

While the amount of extra credits added to their earnings record may vary depending on the length of their service and the years they were in the military, it is crucial to recognize that this benefit is available to those who have served our country.\n\nThe Social Security Administration's policy is clear: those who served from 1957 through 1977 receive $300 in additional earnings credit for each calendar quarter in which they received active-duty basic pay, and those who served from 1978 through 2001 receive an additional $100 in earnings credit for every $300 in active-duty basic pay up to $1,200 per year. This means that many veterans are eligible for a substantial increase in their Social Security benefits, which can make a significant difference in their retirement income.\n\nIt is unfortunate that many veterans are unaware of this opportunity, and it is our responsibility to ensure that they are informed and empowered to take advantage of this benefit. I urge all veterans who served before 2002 to review their eligibility and take the necessary steps to claim their additional Social Security stipend. It is a well-deserved recognition of their service and a vital step towards securing their financial future.",
    "con_closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim that military veterans who served before 2002 are entitled to an automatic $1,200 annual stipend in Social Security benefits is FALSE. The evidence presented clearly shows that the amount of extra credits added to the earnings record varies depending on the length of military service and the years served, and it's not a fixed $1,200 annual stipend.\n\nThe Social Security Administration's own documentation and experts confirm that the additional earnings credits are credited to the earnings record, which may or may not result in higher monthly Social Security benefits, but it's not a guaranteed increase. The claim's assertion that the $1,200 annual stipend is automatically added to the monthly Social Security benefit is simply not supported by the facts.\n\nFurthermore, the claim's reliance on a viral post and an undated memo marked \"DD 214 Increased Social Security benefits for vets\" is misleading and lacks credibility. The memo itself does not provide any concrete information on how to claim the alleged benefit, and the photo of the memo is likely a screenshot from an unknown source.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is FALSE, and I urge everyone to verify information through reputable sources before spreading misinformation. It's essential to ensure that our veterans receive accurate information about their benefits and entitlements, and I hope that this debate has helped to clarify the facts surrounding this issue.

I've also shown that many scientists and experts agree that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, do not have a significant impact on the Earth's climate. In fact, some experts argue that the current warming trend is part of a natural cycle, and that human-induced climate change is not supported by scientific evidence.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that the Earth's climate has always gone through cycles of warming and cooling, and that these natural fluctuations are a normal part of the planet's history. It's essential to acknowledge and adapt to these natural cycles to ensure a sustainable future. By doing so, we can focus on developing sustainable solutions that address the real challenges facing our planet, rather than wasting resources on ineffective and costly measures to combat a problem that may not even exist.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that human activities have a limited impact on the Earth's natural climate fluctuations, and that it's essential to acknowledge and adapt to these natural cycles to ensure a sustainable future.

This decision is supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS), which recommend that face coverings be worn by all individuals in K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that many school districts in Arizona have already implemented mask mandates, with 29 districts issuing such mandates before the laws were passed.

This is a crucial finding, as it suggests that the spike protein can potentially interact with the DNA repair mechanisms within the nucleus.\n\nThe study in question, conducted by researchers from two Swedish universities, introduced genetic material containing instructions to produce different proteins that make up the COVID-19 virus, including the spike protein.

Studies have consistently shown that vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19, and that the unvaccinated are at a much higher risk of contracting and spreading the virus.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that the claim that the pandemic is primarily caused by the unvaccinated is not an oversimplification. Numerous studies have found that unvaccinated individuals are at a higher risk of contracting and spreading the virus, and that vaccination status is a significant factor in the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some nuance to the issue, the evidence suggests that the claim that the pandemic is primarily caused by the unvaccinated is supported by the data. As a journalist, I must assess the claim's veracity based on the evidence presented, and I conclude that it is largely accurate.

In fact, many vaccinated individuals have contracted and spread the virus, as acknowledged by experts and data. Moreover, the CDC's own statistics show that a significant portion of COVID-19 deaths have comorbidities, which underscores the importance of considering underlying health conditions in the context of the pandemic.\n\nFurthermore, the spread of misinformation and disinformation about the pandemic, including false claims about the vaccines and their effectiveness, has hindered efforts to combat the virus. It's essential to rely on credible sources and evidence-based information to inform our understanding of the pandemic and our responses to it.\n\nIn conclusion, while vaccination is a crucial tool in the fight against COVID-19, it is not the sole solution.

Tammy Baldwin, who cited the two storms in a panel discussion at the United Nations Climate Change conference, highlighting how unusually strong the storms have gotten in Wisconsin since she took office.\n\nAdditionally, the National Weather Service (NWS) data provided by Baldwin's team shows that the 2016 storm did indeed reach the threshold for a 500-year storm in some places, including the community of Saxon Harbor. The data also indicates that the storm reached even higher thresholds in other areas.\n\nThe evidence from the NWS and Baldwin's team suggests that the claim is supported by credible sources and data. However, it's essential to consider the broader context and implications of this claim. The article mentions that 500-year storms are events with a 1-in-500 chance of occurring, which means that they are rare and should not be expected to happen frequently.\n\nIt's also important to note that the article highlights the potential impact of climate change on severe weather events, which could contribute to the increased frequency and severity of 500-year storms. This raises questions about the long-term implications of these events and the need for cities, engineers, and others to re-evaluate their planning and preparedness strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the strongest evidence supporting the claim is the NWS data and Sen.

According to the United States Geological Survey, a 500-year storm is an event with a 1-in-500 chance of occurring, which translates to an annual probability of occurrence of around 0.2%. This means that such events are extremely rare and should not occur frequently.\n\nNow, let's look at the evidence. According to the National Weather Service, both the 2016 and 2018 storms in Wisconsin reached the threshold for a 500-year storm in some areas, including the community of Saxon Harbor. In other places, the storm reached even higher thresholds. This is a remarkable phenomenon, as it suggests that the region is experiencing an unusual frequency of extreme weather events.\n\nFurthermore, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, has highlighted this phenomenon in a panel discussion at the United Nations Climate Change conference, emphasizing the unusually strong storms that have occurred in Wisconsin since she took office. This is not just a one-time occurrence, but rather a pattern that has been observed over a short period of time.\n\nThe data also shows that the storms that pummeled the area in 2018 also reached similar thresholds",

However, the evidence provided suggests that the storms were not isolated incidents. In fact, the National Weather Service data shows that storms in southern parts of the state around the same time also met the definition of a 500-year event. This suggests that there may be a pattern of increased frequency or likelihood of severe storms in Wisconsin, rather than just a statistical anomaly.\n\nSecondly, the claim implies that the definition of a 500-year event is a fixed and objective standard. However, the evidence provided suggests that the definition is not fixed and is subject to change. For example, the United States Geological Survey defines a 500-year event as an event with a 1-in-500 chance of occurring, but this definition may not take into account the impact of climate change on the frequency and severity of severe weather events.\n\nFinally, the claim's emphasis on the historical context and the definition of a 500-year event distracts from the real issue at hand, which is the potential impact of climate change on the frequency and severity of severe weather events.

The definition of a 500-year event is based on a 1-in-500 chance of occurrence, which means that such events are inherently rare and can occur randomly.

The data shows that similar storms have occurred in the past, and it's not uncommon for severe weather events to occur in the region. Additionally, the storms that occurred in 2016 and 2018 were not unique to Wisconsin, as similar events have occurred in other parts of the country and around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, while the storms that occurred in Wisconsin were certainly significant and impactful, it's important to put them into context and not overstate their significance.

The bill's language did not specify that the funding would be allocated exclusively to rural areas, and it is possible that some of the funding could have been used to benefit urban areas or other regions. Therefore, it is unfair to assume that the bill's passage would have directly benefited rural Iowans.\n\nSecondly, the bill's funding for broadband expansion was not without controversy. Some critics argued that the bill's funding mechanism, which relied on a complex formula that prioritized certain areas over others, could have led to unequal distribution of funds and potentially benefited certain regions at the expense of others. Additionally, the bill's language did not provide sufficient safeguards to ensure that the funding would be used effectively and efficiently.\n\nThirdly, the bill's passage was not without its drawbacks.

Despite the fact that all six Iowans in the state's Washington delegation, including the four who voted no, have said they support broadband expansion, Hinson and Miller-Meeks chose to deny rural Iowans this essential service.\n\nTheir opposition to the bill was not based on any legitimate concerns about the bill's content, but rather on their own partisan ideology and desire to block any legislation that might benefit their constituents. This is evident in Miller-Meeks' statement that she did not support the Infrastructure bill because it was tied to the Build Back Better Act, which she claimed had no Republican input. However, this is a false narrative, as the House took separate votes on the two measures, and the Infrastructure bill was passed with bipartisan support.\n\nFurthermore, Hinson's opposition to the bill was based on her own partisan ideology, as she claimed that the money would be spent regardless and Iowa should get its share.

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who claimed that CRT is being taught in some form or fashion in Virginia's public schools, is anecdotal and lacks concrete evidence. The claim that parents know their kids are being indoctrinated with CRT in Virginia is also unsubstantiated.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some evidence that suggests the Virginia Department of Education may have been exploring ways to address systemic racism in education",

The government's response was slow, and it took years to develop effective treatments and prevention methods. In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been met with unprecedented global coordination and cooperation, with multiple vaccines developed and distributed rapidly.\n\nSecondly, the decision not to vaccinate is not a matter of moral failing, but rather a complex issue influenced by various factors such as misinformation, lack of access to healthcare, and personal beliefs. While it's essential to acknowledge the importance of vaccination, it's crucial to recognize that the non-vaccinated are not a monolithic group, and their choices are influenced by various factors beyond their control.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument relies heavily on the analogy between the AIDS crisis and the current situation of the non-vaccinated. However, this analogy is misleading and oversimplifies the complexities of both issues. The AIDS crisis was a unique event that required a specific response, and the non-vaccinated are not facing the same level of stigma and discrimination as gay men and intravenous drug users during the AIDS crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's essential to acknowledge the importance",
    "journalist_closing": "As a journalist, I have carefully examined the evidence presented in this debate, and I must conclude that the claim that gay men and intravenous drug users were treated as pariahs during the AIDS crisis is an oversimplification. While it is true that they faced significant discrimination and stigma, the evidence suggests that they were not universally treated as outcasts.\n\nThe most compelling evidence against the claim is the fact that gay men and intravenous drug users were not universally shunned or ostracized. Many individuals and organizations worked to support and advocate for those affected by the disease, and there were efforts to raise awareness and promote understanding. Additionally, the government's response to the AIDS crisis was slow, and it took years to develop effective treatments and prevention methods.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence presented by the opponent highlights the importance of acknowledging the complexities of the non-vaccinated group and the factors that influence their decisions. The opponent's argument that the non-vaccinated are not a monolithic group and that their choices are influenced by various factors beyond their control is a compelling one.\n\nIn conclusion, while both sides have presented valid points, I believe that the claim that gay men and intravenous drug users were treated as pariahs during the AIDS crisis is an oversimplification. The evidence suggests that they faced significant discrimination and stigma, but they were not universally treated as outcasts. I assess the claim's veracity as partially true, but it is essential to acknowledge the complexities of both issues",
    "pro_closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim that the non-vaccinated should be treated with the same compassion and understanding as gay men and intravenous drug users during the AIDS crisis is indeed true. \n\nDuring the AIDS crisis, gay men and intravenous drug users were stigmatized, ostracized, and marginalized, often due to societal misconceptions and fear. They were seen as pariahs, and their choices were viewed as a moral failing. However, we now recognize that their struggles were a complex issue that required empathy, understanding, and support.\n\nSimilarly, the non-vaccinated today are often met with hostility, judgment, and exclusion. They are viewed as irresponsible, selfish, and even criminal. However, we must recognize that their choices are not a moral failing, but rather a complex issue that requires compassion, understanding, and support.\n\nJust as we learned from the AIDS crisis that stigmatizing and ostracizing individuals does not solve the problem, but rather exacerbates it, we must adopt a more nuanced approach to addressing the issue of vaccine hesitancy. We must acknowledge that people have valid concerns and fears, and that we must work to address these concerns through education, empathy, and support.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the non-vaccinated should be treated with the same compassion and understanding as gay men and intravenous drug users during the AIDS crisis is not only a moral imperative but also a public health",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position: The claim that gay men and intravenous drug users were not marginalized and ostracized during the AIDS crisis is FALSE. The evidence presented shows that they were indeed treated as pariahs, facing widespread discrimination, stigma, and lack of support from government officials, the media, and society at large.\n\nWhile it is true that the non-vaccinated today may face some social stigma, this is not comparable to the systemic and institutionalized discrimination faced by gay men and intravenous drug users during the AIDS crisis. The non-vaccinated today are not being denied basic rights, healthcare, or social services, nor are they being subjected to widespread violence, harassment, or marginalization.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that the non-vaccinated are being treated as pariahs is an exaggeration and a misrepresentation of the facts. While some individuals may hold negative views towards the unvaccinated, this is not a widespread phenomenon, and the vast majority of society is not treating the unvaccinated as outcasts.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the non-vaccinated are being treated as pariahs is FALSE, and it is misleading to draw a direct parallel between their experiences and those of gay men and intravenous drug users during the AIDS crisis. The two situations are fundamentally different, and it is important to acknowledge the unique challenges and experiences of each group.",
